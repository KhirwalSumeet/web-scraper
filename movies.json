[{"Name":"Naam Shabana","Release Time":"Mar 31 2017","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Akshay Kumar, Manoj Bajpayee, Taapsee Pannu, Prithviraj Sukumaran","Director":"Shivam Nair","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 28 minutes"},{"Name":"Poorna","Release Time":"Mar 30 2017","Critic rating":"4.0/5","Cast":"Aditi Inamdar, S. Mariya, Rahul Bose, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Heeba Shah, Gyanendra Tripathi, Arif Zakaria","Director":"Rahul Bose","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 40 minutes","Review":" Everyone loves the story of an unfortunate and ill-equipped underdog who conquers their fears, realizes their true potential and goes on to overcome a towering challenge. 'Poorna' embodies this narrative in a very literal sense. In the absence of the element of surprise (the outcome is clearly advertised in the film’s poster and trailer), the challenge is no less monumental for writers Prashant Pandey and Shreya Dev Verma.  movie  Tasked with weaving the tale of Poorna's journey, they add compelling elements to the protagonist’s character which Aditi Inamdar plays with innocence and naivete. Under Bose’s direction, she hits most of the significant emotional beats with fellow newcomer S. Mariya who plays her cousin Priya, though Inamdar's strongest scenes are alongside Bose himself. His understated performance as the mentor and facilitator Dr. R S Praveen Kumar is anchored by supporting actors Dhritiman Chatterjee, Heeba Shah and Gyanendra Tripathi who lend the film with ample gravitas.  Bose is as comfortable in front of the camera as he is behind it, allowing for an ebb and flow to the narrative that keeps you totally engrossed during its taut runtime. As an additional component, the tracks by Salim – Sulaiman are refreshing and catchy while complimenting the story. However, the odd choice to use Telugu interspersed with Hindi and English dialogues in the absence of subtitles is a minor grouch; one that doesn’t detract from the film’s overall impact, but could have probably lent to a far more realistic and seamless viewing experience.  Returning to a directorial capacity after 16 years, Rahul Bose recognizes the beauty in simplicity and uses it to the film's advantage. Grounded performances combined with stirring music elevate this relatively straightforward tale, making it essential viewing not only for the young Indian woman, but for anyone looking to scale great heights against all odds.

It is about a woman, who fights to uphold her right to dignity.  Given its risqué subject, the film could have gone awfully wrong if the execution had faltered or tilted on sleazy over substance. But writer, director Avinash Das’ execution lends gravitas to the proceedings, making you feel for the lead character.  Most importantly, this film finally gives Swara Bhaskar an opportunity to put her exemplary acting chops on display. She is a revelation as a pan-chewing, courageous woman, who won’t buckle under pressure. Ishtiyak Khan of ‘Tamasha’ fame is impressive too. The music compliments the film’s raw and rustic setting as well.  Giving you the other side of the picture, this captivating drama makes you think. Can we respect women, who perform Bhojpuri item songs? More often than not, you are quick to suspect if they are moonlighting as sex workers. They must be apologetic about themselves and if they aren’t, it’s the society’s ‘duty’ to slut-shame these audacious women on moral grounds. The film sheds light on this perception and reiterates what ‘Pink’ implied to the urban audience - No means no. Every woman has a right to say ‘no’, irrespective of who she is or what she does for a living. However, what doesn’t work here is the absence of a strong antagonist. Sanjay Mishra’s comic villainry fails to unnerve you, making the climax look a tad convenient and underwhelming.  The patriarchal society has a way of holding women responsible for the atrocities they themselves face. This movie questions this very mind-set and offers a refreshing take on women and their sexuality.

Simple- you don't! His brand of comedy seems a tad outdated, which explains why it must have been difficult for the super entertainer to make a dashing comeback. Aa Gaya Hero is a testament to why his films may not have worked of late.  movie  With an inexistent story, all the film does is glorify Govinda. The actor tries hard to bring in his trademark swag as he plays the James Bond-like cop. He is fearless and has a way of convincing everyone. As a supercop, he introduces something called an 'Abhinay Chakra' to the Home Minister. The whole idea is to act out a planned operation in order to catch a supervillain, whose only identity is a maniacal laugh.  As is expected from a Govinda movie, there are song and dance sequences, over-the-top dialogues and the likes. But in Aa Gaya Hero, he tries to eclipse all the mindless comedies of the 90's while doing a supposedly serious role, dressed in track suits and tuxedos.  There are actors like Ashutosh Rana, Milind Shinde, Makarand Deshpande and Murli Sharma who are completely wasted. The film is full of inconsequential comedy that goes on for two hours and if you survive by the end of it, a ‘Finisher’ trophy is the least the makers can give you.  Not to forget, our Bond-esque Chi Chi woos multiple arm-candies and breaks into a dance every five minutes throughout the movie. Unfortunately, besides the actor’s trademark dance moves, there is nothing worth watching here. The 'hero' might just need to make another comeback soon and hopefully a more 'relevant' one this time.

Does no one with an ounce of objectivity intervene at any point? Anyway, here we are, and here it is.  Ransh (Mustafa) is a machine (the heroine’s words, not ours), who has no heart. He is made to fall in love with girls, then made to kill them and steal their money. Sarah (Advani) becomes his victim and but is soon resurrected to bring down her sly lover when he’s on his next hunt. Her saviour? The twin brother of a friendzoned Romeo who dies at the hands of Ransh earlier. If the existential crisis hasn’t set in yet, give it time. Two hours and 28 minutes, to be precise.  The lack of any kind of subtlety is the most astounding thing here. If a boy is in love, he will write love letters in blood; if a girl is upset, she will sit by the river and sob endlessly; everything is spelled out (in cringe-worthy dialogue) and then underlined and highlighted, should people miss the point. Songs show up as if they’re following a schedule and can’t miss the deadline.  How is this coming from the same directors who pulled off taut thrillers until the early ‘00s? Like Baazigar, the Abbas-Mustan movie that sealed the deal for Shah Rukh Khan. They have revived the same plot as a launch vehicle for Mustafa, but have forgotten that little depends on the vehicle and a lot is determined by the man behind the wheel. And Mustafa, suspiciously surrounded by obviously less talented is just not that man. Kiara Advani is almost certainly binge-watching Deepika Padukone movies and picking up nuances of her dialogue delivery and expressions. There’s an eerie Padukone vibe about the way Advani walks, talks and looks.  This machine has been put together without any manual and starts falling apart as soon as it is turned on.

The multinationals are buying out the market as he fights, what seems like a losing battle, to save his company. But that's just the professional front. His personal life, too, is in a mess. While his eldest son Viraj (Shiv Pandit) is pursuing his own restaurant business, his younger daughter Pia (Kalki Koechlin) is desperately looking to break out and live on her own. His youngest Vir (Rohan Joshi) is head over heels in a virtual affair with married woman with kids and his wife is just on the cusp of wanting a divorce because of the sheer lack of intimacy or romance. Kapil, meanwhile, maintains a straight face and a graceful smile, while all else around him crumbles.  It's refreshing to see, that in a film only 90 minutes long, just how the director manages to narrate multiple stories in an effective and engaging manner. Each character, however brief, is cast perfectly. Rajat Kapoor's role as the stoic father struggling to do the right thing, Shiv Pandit as the angry son with his own battles to fight, and even Adil Hussain's heart-warming cameo, stand out.  The film is more a collection of anecdotes which reflect a dysfunctional family fighting to stay afloat amidst the chaos that life in urban India is. A crowd funded effort, Mantra is a brave film that delves into the complex world of urban relationships and poses the right questions.  In a bid to cover all bases, the film does fall short in reaching a clear conclusion and the execution falls short in places. Still, the story and performances make sure you are involved till the very end.  "},{"Name":"Trapped","Release Time":"Mar 16 2017","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Rajkummar Rao, Geetanjali Thapa","Director":"Vikramaditya Motwane","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"1 hour 42 minutes","Review":" ‘Trapped’ centres on one man’s fight for survival. He is not on a deserted island (‘Cast Away’) or an isolated canyon (‘127 Hours’) or an ocean (‘Life of Pi’) but in a Mumbai apartment, right in the middle of a crowded street. Vikramaditya Motwane’s brilliance lies in turning this unsuspecting setup into a hellish playground.  Denial turns into panic as the sun sets and a sense of claustrophobia creeps in making you hold your breath. You feel imprisoned on that flat along with the protagonist who does whatever it takes to survive, even facing his fear of rats. His hallucinations become yours. Hunger can turn one into a beast, so this one’s certainly not for the faint-hearted. It often makes your squirm in your seat with its appalling proceedings. You do heave a sigh of relief after the film ends and value your freedom on walking out. The thought that you have the privilege to gorge on some buttery roadside Pav Bhaji that Shaurya couldn’t, is a testament to the makers’ victory.  Driving this one-man show is a terrific Rajkummar Rao, who allows the film to solely feed on his character’s despair. His ability as an actor to portray this ordeal is astounding. Geetanjali Thapa is pleasant.  However, given the nature of the story, ‘Trapped’ does test your patience after a while. You also doubt the protagonist’s intelligence and sanity. Why would you rent a flat from a dubious agent, in an empty building? A few occurrences seem implausible. How come even fire doesn’t draw any attention? Nonetheless, the mounting tension makes you overlook these flaws and a bloated run time. ‘SH** happens’!

Born in a traditional Catholic family, she faces sexism early on from her parents. In college, she falls in love with Alex (Himansh Kohli) and thinks it will last forever. However, they marry her off to a Rajasthani Prince Vikram Pratap Singh (Ashutosh Rana) for money. A violent psychopath, he is a textbook masochist with a history of ill-treating women in his family. Somewhat unhappy, Alia still gives away all her freedom and is content with sitting at home. But when she is forced to abort her unborn daughter, she leaves the haveli with the help of a close aide Lakshmi (Supriya Pathak), and flees to Mumbai. Here, she gives birth to her baby girl and turns over a new leaf as she starts a journey as a writer that will eventually take her to New York. She gets another chance at love in the form of NRI philanthropist Aditya Kapoor (Arbaaz Khan). But will she take it, or have the hardships she faced in life made her too bitter to accept love?  A clear case of riding the wave of women-centric films, Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai has an overly simplistic approach at dealing with serious issues that concern women. In the process, it reduces the broad topic to end up just serving itself and ends up becoming nothing more than a shoddily made, formula film.  Actors like Ashutosh Rana and Supriya Pathak seem to be completely underused. As for Manjari Faddnis, it’s sad to see so much wasted. Prem Chopra, as the purist Urdu editor who helps Alia, adds nothing to the film and is reduced to being used for comic relief.

However, it fails to be anything more than a stereotype of similar movies that have been around the subject, both in Bollywood and Hollywood.  movie  Set in a hostel campus, Mona_Darling starts the exercise in stereotyping from the word go, as a bunch of drunk college students ham up about a friend request they get on social media from the college hottie, Mona (Suzanna Mukherjee). The guys, who look like they need a good bath, are chewed up and the police are called to investigate the mysterious deaths. A parallel investigation is undertaken by Mona’s best friend Sarah (Divya Menon) who ropes in the socially awkward, stereotypical, fruit-munching geek named Wiki (Anshuman Jha). College Dean Chaturvedi (Sanjay Suri) too helps in the search as more as more deaths occur. However, when Mona herself is found dead and the friend request still don’t cease, the story goes into horror territory as it tries to keep you guessing whether it’s a ghost or human who has done the deed. More stereotypes occur in the form of MMS scandals, creepy librarians and so on.  As far as thrillers are concerned, some essential elements are a tight story, an unexpected twist and a couple of nice frights. In this one, all three are missing. There are only about four or five good, hearty frights and the first half is painfully slow in establishing the mystery. The only reason to watch the second half is to know who is killing everyone; a ghost, the internet or are you merely being taken on a ride. A saving grace is the twist, which is so weak that one can spot it fairly early in the second half and just wait to be proven right. Its conclusion is decent, but until then almost two, unentertaining hours have elapsed. Shot stylishly, this movie is high on style and low on substance.  The only effort that Anshuman Jha, who was acclaimed for his role in Love Sex Aur Dhokha does, is to look young and recite gibberish medical terms. Suzanna Mukherjee shows promise and has a decent screen presence while Divya Menon too is convincing as the troubled friend.  Go for it if you're a fan of horror films. Else, it's totally missable.

By doing just that, director Shekhar S Jha makes the viewer go through endless conversations that are so heavy on the mind that one is ought to doze off sooner or later.  movie  Kahani (Gill) has made all preparations for a romantic wedding anniversary celebration but Nirbhay (Chatterjee, in a cameo) has to stay back in Mumbai for a meeting. Furious at the change of plans, Kahani fights with Nirbhay and dozes off while reading a book. Soon after, the doorbell rings and Kahani is surprised to find Nagarjun (Patekar), the author of the book she’s reading, at her doorstep. The two hit it off with Nagarjun sharing interesting anecdotes and experiences about love. Both of them move around Goa and come across different couples that bring out various aspects of a relationship. In the process, Nagarjun makes Kahani understand that love is about understanding each other first.  The biggest problem with this film is its heavy reliance on monologues; Patekar is just waiting to break into one. Throughout the film, he speaks and Gill listens. At times when they are not doing that, she asks questions and he starts speaking again. Yes, Patekar knows the art of enunciation and reciting poetry, and it helps him sail through this particular role. But the veteran’s command on the craft alone isn’t enough to salvage the movie. Gill, who has played strong women characters in the past, tries hard but is a misfit in this role.  If you have issues in your love-life, visit a marriage counsellor. Wedding Anniversary will only add some phrases to your Hindi/ Urdu vocabulary.

While we don’t hear many elopment tales anymore, at least in big cities, it still is a phenomenon in smaller towns. Mix that with technology and you have Running Shaadi, where writer Navjot Gulati and director Amit Roy pen a tight little romcom.  movie  And it’s not just about eloping. The egalitarian relationship that the leading pair develops is commendable yet believable. They talk about her menstrual cycle, discuss premarital sex, abortions and other ‘sensitive’ topics casually, like how most young people do. A headstrong girl and a wild child at heart, Nimmy is totally in on Bharose’s latest, risky business venture --- a matrimonial website that helps couples elope. Until the first half, the film convinces you about their absurd business concept. But it’s in the second half that the film really takes off and takes you along for a joyride. The twists, albeit expected, are entertaining and the comedy is very relevant; there’s always a chuckle around. The characters are believable and face realistic dilemmas in their lives.  The real fun parts, though, are that of the supporting cast. Be it Cyber with his subdued, subtle role as a nerdy sidekick, or Bharose’s English spouting Bihari uncle played by Brijendra Kala, or his to-be brother-in-law and his family or the many couples who the trio help elope --- they are all hilarious. The story is funny and irreverent and the performances up to the mark. The music never gets in the way of the story and the length, at 1 hour 55 minutes, is just right. While the constant beeping out of the .com at the end of the title is a tad irritating, you can let that slide considering the film was stuck in limbo for three years.  While there may not be much of a Shaadi, there's definitely a lot of fun running around that you may want to check out.

Having picked up a subject that talks of environmental hazards, debutant director Aparnaa Singh’s conscientious streak shows. Her film that is being marketed as an eco-thriller (whatever!) draws inspiration from Hollywood thriller Erin Brockovich (2000).However, unlike the Hollywood film that managed to raise a red flag warning us of how pharmaceutical companies are playing with innocent lives, Irada barely scratches the surface.  The film's attempt to educate the audience on the perils of chemical contamination, reverse boring and groundwater pollution that is a harsh reality around urban townships is half-baked.  Actually the film’s failing is it’s amateur writing and execution. You can see that the maker is crushed under the weight of the material chosen. The treatment also yo-yos. On the one hand, you feel anguish when Naseer loses his daughter and when the ``cancer train’’ is brought on board to convey the enormity of the crisis looming over us. But on the other hand, the film leaves you stone-cold because of the consistencies in the character sketches and screenplay. While Naseeruddin and Arshad are perfect, the villain Paddy F Sharma (Sharad Kelkar) and his partner-in-crime, CM, Ramandeep Braitch(Divya Dutta) are absolute caricatures.  There is also a sub-plot of a journalist (Sagarika Ghatge) seeking revenge for her dead boyfriend. Even this track is really weak. If intention is everything, you may feel kindly towards Irada. Unfortunately when it comes to a celluloid experience, story-telling is prime. Here, the film falters.

This is it then; Hind Ka Napak ko Jawab — MSG Lion Heart - 2, the third foray of the godman, Dr Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan aka Dr MSG, into the world of movies. On paper, he is an Indian spy called Sher-e-Hind, feared by all and hell-bent on taking revenge against Pakistan for all the terrorist attacks on India. On screen though, he is like a six-foot-tall baby, stumbling around in a crockery shop with an AK 47.  Armed with his smartwatch and sidekick Honey Preet, MSG (let’s call him that) assumes the role of a covert James Bond minus the tuxedo or class. For a spy, he sticks out like a sore, rainbow-coloured thumb, riding a purple bike/helicopter and a heavily modified orange car in enemy territory.  His gadgets, too, are mind-boggling. There’s a ring that spouts butterflies, a watch that does just about everything besides travelling through time and other miscellaneous rings that turn into modified vehicles, bombs, etc.  The hilarious bits really kick in when MSG romances his Pakistani love interest Sargam (Diksha Insan). It’s a joy to see him be coy and awkward around her, considering he is an oddity beyond imagination in the entire film. Both admit their love for each other as if reading from teleprompters. In fact, the entire cast seems to be reading from teleprompters as they recite their lines. And then there’s the music. For fans of the previous hit Love 'Charzer', there are many such moments to rejoice; like when MSG does squats as the camera pans on his gluteal muscles, or when he strolls through pink origami trees, or plays (tickles) an acoustic guitar.  As far as the patriotic angle is concerned, the Uri attacks and India’s surgical strikes are relegated to the fag end. The main enemies, in Scientology fashion, are the aliens who have been hunting MSG for 300 years. As MSG defeats the aliens, in what looks like the end of the movie, you’re hit square in the face with a grammatical error — ‘To Be Continue’. Whether you’re a follower or a connoisseur of bad films, you’re bound to take this one as nothing more than a comedy, where the leading man defeats every shred of your sensibility.

But all kids in India don’t get that. At times, there are economic factors and other times, which happens more often than we think, there are social factors that deprive kids from getting proper education. Alif is a film that tries to address that fact.  Raza (Danish) is filled with guilt as he marries off his sister Zahara (Neelima Azeem) to Pakistan after the 1993 riots. She has a hell of a time there, but still, when she returns, she hasn’t been defeated by her circumstances there. Her heart is still tender and her views progressive. She wants Raza’s son Ali (Saud Mansuri) to quit the local Arabic seminary in Banaras and study to be a doctor instead. Their neighbour is a poet --- (Aditya Om), a hardliner himself who teaches in the seminary. Raza agrees to send his son to an English medium school instead of an Arabic madrasa. However, it is not easy for little Ali to make the transition. He has to cram 12 years’ worth of English and face hellish treatment from teachers who don’t like a madrasa kid in their midst. They try to derail his education and treat him mercilessly. Meanwhile, Raza, in order to keep his sister in India, falls prey to blackmail by a neighbourhood teacher in the seminary, who threatens to crush his chances of making up to Zahara.  Marketed as a ‘festival’ film, Alif has many good points, along with a strong story, which shows how an orthodox approach to education, in this case in Islam, can ruin lives; both young and old. However, execution and performances fail this film from rising above being anything more than a film with a ‘message’. The actors are shrill and over the top in their performances barring Danish, who plays it so understated that his emotions barely come through. Neelima is the only saving grace, as she brings a certain warmth and humanity to this bleak landscape.

But is it a successful effort? Barely.  Arnab Ghosh (Sunil Grover) is a table-thumping, loud-mouthed journalist modelled after a popular prime time news anchor. His antics, though they generate ratings, fail to amuse the channel boss, who relegates him to a less important slot as the host of a cooking show. Disturbed by the demotion and with a heavily pregnant wife (Anjana Sukhani), he decides to go for the big kill – an interview with the dreaded don D (Zakir Hussain). He lures the don out to grant him an interview and accompanies a fashion writer (Dipannita Sharma) and his two-man crew to Pakistan.  movie  For a film that is a satirical take on news channels, it gets its facts askew for comedy’s sake, which is granted. Still, the TV channel shenanigans of Arnab are downplayed – you only see one scene in the studio, which is loud, forced and not really funny. There are funnier skits online. The first half is a weak build-up to the interview with D, which makes up the rest of the film. While the dialogue is clever in the interview, where D is seen as a masterful manipulator, it does drag and you find your attention wavering. Yet the climax does take you by surprise.  Sunil Grover swerves between playing Arnab and an SRK lookalike. Anjana Sukhani, as the pregnant-yet-bashful wife Parul, gives a lazy performance. Dipannita Sharma’s character exists; it seems, purely for the sake of misogynistic jokes. Zakir Hussain as D and Pankaj Tripathi who plays his sidekick Girdhari, perform brilliantly. Tripathi steals the show with his spot-on comic timing. You wish he had a bigger role.  It could have been good film, but the undoing of Coffee With D is its post-production. The film is let down by shoddy editing and a bad dubbing job where entire sentences are muted and out of sync. A story that has potential is ruined by poor execution that distracts you from the plot.

Even Shakti Kapoor as a corrupt inspector, is such a weak villain, that you feel cheated out of watching his act as the baddie.  If given a choice, you're better off watching an early 2000 TV soap unless you like your movies full of forced thrills, a warped logic and, two dimensional acting and with Shakti Kapoor as a de-fanged, wimp of a villain.

Kamal loves Sandhya and Mintu suggests bizarre ways to help Kamal woo the girl. The two rightly suspect that something’s brewing between Sandhya and Shyam and thus end up following the two everywhere. Meanwhile, completely unaware of the boys’ intentions, Sandhya, abandoned by her mother and concerned for her standoffish father, finds solace in Shyam. She overlooks his violent outbursts as her sexual involvement with him, clouds her judgement. Shyam on the contrary, is an opportunist, who manipulates the girl and even his wife for his selfish interests. However, he is not entirely at fault as the girl voluntarily leads him on.  Haraamkhor addresses a significant issue without taking sides and that’s commendable. Sadly, the righteous social awareness disclaimers that appear frequently during the ‘diluted controversial’ scenes, do not embody the film’s dark humour or audacious nature.  The jumpy narrative leaves a lot unanswered, making you feel indifferent towards the characters. It’s nice when a filmmaker leaves certain things to the audience’s interpretation but Shlok Sharma expects way too much from his unsuspecting viewer. It’s tiresome to fill in the blanks after a while. Those who have seen the film at a festival claim that a few scenes have been cut and what you get is a water-down version. Whatever the reason, they seem disconnected and that puts you off.  What shines in this otherwise bold but ambiguous film are the performances and Mukesh Chhabra’s impeccable casting, especially when it comes to the young boys. Shweta Tripathi stuns you as a 31-year-old, playing a 14 something with her understated portrayal. Nawazuddin Siddiqui once again proves why he is considered to be one of the finest actors of today. He is effortlessly flawless and evokes diverse emotions like anger, disdain and laughter with an easy nonchalance.  Haraamkhor shows a lot of promise but ends up being way too vague to be hard-hitting.

But Prakash Electronics packs too much – melodrama, a message and suspense in a movie that is an hour too long.  An orphan, our protagonist Prakash is conned out of the property his parents left him by his sister and brother-in-law. An introvert by nature, butt an overall nice guy, he grows up to be a moderately successful electrician and does pro bono repair work for neighbours. A pretty girl, Barkha (Hrishita Bhatt), rents a house in his building and he is smitten and wants to marry her. There’s only one problem here. No, it’s not that Barkha is way out of his league. Just that Barkha is an aspiring actress and Prakash doesn’t like people who work in films. According to him, “Film industry waali ladkiyan aise waise kaam karti hain.”  In a film that tries to dispel the myth that all actresses take the casting couch route to stardom, it’s surprising that Prakash doubts her character on more than one occasion. Interestingly, the only word beeped out in the film is ‘item’, which is how most of the characters refer to Barkha. Still, misogyny is not the weakest point in the film. As a viewer, you’re cheated of a twist concerning Prakash’s romantic life, which could have been fun to watch. It does have a handful of funny scenes, but you have to wait for the jokes through cringe-inducing melodrama.  Prakash Electronics itself is in serious need of repair on its script, music and jokes.

But can we handle a bunch of them, say seven, in one go? Looking at Shor Se Shuruaat, it’s evident we can. The film delves into the subject of noise through seven stories, each presenting a unique take and dealing with real-life issues.  Sound here, is not just presented as one of the five human senses; the filmmakers deal with the word in its entirety. There’s the starting film Aazad where, not just the writer but also those around him, pay the price for his habit of saying the truth. Then there is Aamer, which tackles sound purely as a sense through the eyes of a young street kid in Mumbai.  Decibel, takes a dystopian look at sounds being banned in the future and how that may affect us. Dhwani is another dark yet life-affirming short on how an inmate on death row, who is scared of dying, peacefully accepts the fate that awaits him.  The omnibus has its low moments in the form of Hell O Hello, a take on shrill advertisements. When you feel the short film drags, in comes a song. Yellow Tin Can Telephone is about cross connection between senses. It tells its story in a refreshing manner. Though an overkill of style and colour, it leaves you happy. Mia I'm is based in the North-East and deals with MMS scandals and their effect on the victim. It has a lot of strong moments and talks about teenage angst and how one bounces back after life-altering events.  The performances are strong, especially those by Sanjay Mishra, Vijay Maurya, Pawan Manda Kale and Baia Marbaniang, the last two who are untrained actors.  Overall, Shor Se Shuruat is like a string of crackers where some burst beautifully while a few just make noise.

Because in half a day, he finds accommodation, within minutes he aces the copy test at his office certifying him as a veritable genius content writer, and before the day ends, he has found the love of his life, too! And marriage, you ask? Easy. He breezes into his girlfriend Shivangi’s (Hrishita Bhatt) home, pushes away the suitor as matchmaking is in process, and with the help of Raju (Mukesh Bhatt), the estate agent who also got him his house, settles the date when he will tie the knot; all this before the coffee even cools. Why then is he berated by those around him, you wonder, for not knowing the value of time? Well, because Shashank is a full-blown psycho, driven crazy by the beatings he suffered at the hands of his alcoholic father (Kanwarjit Paintal). And whenever he is challenged to finish a task under 30 minutes, his inner Hulk emerges berating and killing those who dared to defy him.  While the film follows the rules of time, it defies common sense. With a loose story, shoddy execution and a desperate attempt to cram as many songs as possible, there are very few strong points. For a thriller, you can see almost every twist in the plot way before it unfolds. The performances are not up to the mark either. Hrishita is either madly in love or just plain angry. While Paintal Jr's Hulk act is not the weakest thing in the film, it does get stale and repetitive fairly soon. The film does try to address the issue of physical violence against kids, but ends up doing mere lip service.

He invests a lot of time in the lives of residents in his neighborhood slum. He is fighting a case against a developer for the slum dwellers rights. Along with help from junior engineer Avinash Joshi (Atul Kulkarni) and plenty of shrill, generic advice from his mother (Kishore Ballal), he stands for the local municipal elections. His nemesis is the local goon Sarphite (Ashok Samarth) and Mrs Angela who speaks Hindi like Captain Russell from Lagaan. They want to chase away the poor and make malls on five acres of slum land.  In the first half, which moves at a snail pace, the slum dwellers win the case and are set to make the apartment complex of their dreams. There is no tension or suspense. The fact that SRA projects are complex, time consuming endeavours where a lot of slum dwellers get raw deals is all airbrushed.  The second half is about how you can take people out of a slum, but you can't take the slum out of them, as the residents try to adjust to life in a building which gets a chuckle or two here and there, but that's all. The end is tepid and uneventful. Sadanand Shetty may be a determined social activist, but he is no actor. Atul Kulkarni barely gets a chance to show his acting chops while Sunil Pal's act as a drunk falls terribly flat. Aasra is more of a 'how to' guide to the slum rehabilitation process. But at two hours and seven minutes, it’s a long and uneventful one.

He does all kinds of deals, black and white and sees a lot of money exchange hands, but all he gets is a very small piece of action. He wants a bigger piece of the pie and is ready to cheat his own company to get that. His wife Divya (Neha Dhupia), a news producer discourages him, but he hides his schemes from her. His game ends badly and he reveals it all to Divya. He shows his vulnerable side to her, but Divya is too emotionally detached to play along. Yet she does and the emotional price she pays is big.  movie  Ranvir Shorey has played characters from Delhi in his previous films, and like every time, it's a joy to watch him play them. He's a total scum yet capable of loving selflessly. He is a product of his environment where a scam pulled off neatly is a job well done. As his schemes gets murkier, we see the terrified human side to him and empathise with him. Neha Dhupia barely does justice to her character as a cold and calculative career woman. While her world is white, the secrets she is party to are just as dark, if not more, than her husband's. But when she realises the emotional toll that life is taking on her, makes for an interesting watch.  The story builds quite well and keeps you guessing. The twists are interesting, unexpected and add to the story. It has a non-linear narrative, but it's not tough to follow. However, the loose ends could have been tied up well, and the end leaves you wanting more. Although it's a well made crime thriller, there are a few loose ends which could have been tied up well.

Ruia","Genre":"Horror","Duration":"1 hour 41 minutes","Review":" Horror films in Bollywood are more or less a combination of clichéd thrills, possessed women and sex; the last one pulling more people to cinema halls than the other two combined. Saansein’s formula is not very different but it doesn’t fixate too much on erotic scenes. There is a horny ghost of a jilted lover though. Yes, that’s the ‘horror’ you have to deal with.  movie   So our damsel in distress, Shirin, sings soulful romantic numbers at a happening club but every day, as the clock strikes 12.30 am, she disappears. After a guy dies under mysterious circumstances while trying to get too close to her, a police investigation begins and Shirin is the prime suspect. Soon after, our knight in shining armour, Abhay, comes to Mauritius and falls in love with Shirin. But love stories aren’t that simple, are they? One night, at the behest of Shirin’s friend and boss Tania (Neetha Shetty), Abhay witnesses the torture Shirin has to endure at the hands of a ghost (yes, the horny one). Turns out, the ghost is that of a jilted lover from Shirin’s ‘pichhla janam’. Well, who would’ve known?  Saansein offers occasional thrills and catches you unaware at times, but for the large part, it’s only patience that can get you through. From people inexplicably dying, to a highly possessive ghost raping a mortal (a la Tabu’s forgettable film Hawa), Saansein veers from comical to illogical. Rajniesh and Sonarika add glamour, Hiten, who plays an exorcist, looks out of place and Neetha’s only job is to feel bad for Sonarika’s character.  Grammatically speaking, ‘The Last Breath’ should be ‘Saans’ and not ‘Saansein’ but that really is the least of our concerns. The saving grace of the movie is a comparatively short running time."},{"Name":"Tum Bin 2","Release Time":"Nov 18 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Aditya Seal, Neha Sharma, Aashim Gulati","Director":"Anubhav Sinha","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 26 minutes"},{"Name":"Force 2","Release Time":"Nov 18 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha, Tahir Raj Bhasin","Director":"Abhinay Deo","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"2 hours 26 minutes"},{"Name":"Ishq Junoon: The Heat is On","Release Time":"Nov 11 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Divya Singh,  Rajbeer Singh, Akshay Rangshahi","Director":"Sanjay Sharma","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"1 hour 53 minutes","Review":" Pakhi (Divya Singh), a small-town girl, wants the good things in life.

She and Raj then take a weekend trip to the latter’s farmhouse where they meet his friend/brother Vir (Akshay Rangshahi), and things start to get really weird.  movie  There are sex thrillers and there are psycho thrillers. Ishq Junoon is a hybrid of the two, which exists in a very strange territory. But it’s more funny-strange than scary-strange. And most times, right-out weird. In the film, orphans are adopted as house helps. A grown woman makes love to two teenage boys. A lingerie sniffing pervert who only speaks in a baritone. A steroid-laden loverboy whose idea of a threesome is not a planned/chance encounter, but marriage. And since we’re on the subject, Ishq Junoon, which has been promoted as ‘India’s first threesome film’, has no threesomes in it. None! There’s one that happens in a dream sequence and that’s it.  The movie had its posters burnt for promoting threesomes and hurting national morals. They shouldn’t have, because the view the film takes of the ménage à trois is so dark, promoting the idea is the last thing that it does.

But stories from the Sikh mythology have rarely been portrayed on screen.  movie  The Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur is a sequel to 2014’s Chaar Sahibzaade and shifts focus from Guru Gobind Singh’s four sons, to the disciple who took his legacy forward.  Guru Gobind Singh visits sage Madho Das and urges him not to throw away his acute sense of justice and archery skills for a life of asceticism.  Madho Das then transforms into Khalsa warrior Banda Singh Bahadur. He leads the Sikh army into Mughal territories, slowly breaking their stronghold over Punjab, and along the way, avenges the death of Guru Gobind Singh’s family.  Director Harry Baweja and co-writer Harman Baweja have chosen an intrinsically interesting story to tell. Banda Singh’s training, his battles with the Mughals, his own shortcomings all have the ingredients for a good narrative, which keeps you in your seat even when the animation makes you stir in it.  And make you stir, it will. Subpar animation just doesn’t do justice to a story of this scale. It is like watching Baahubali through a Chota Bheem filter.  The songs are a distraction and the first half can get very verbose and is entirely too long. It appears to be a revision of the first Chaar Sahibzaade movie, because the story of Banda Singh actually only starts in the second half.  Put simply, if you were the kid who secretly played book-cricket in history class, you may find the movie tedious, but if stories of brave soldiers and great wars excite you, march on into that theatre.

A producer looking to avoid the tax man needs a flop film and hires the services of Masoom (Om Puri), a failed writer who works out of a food court at the local mall. The money is good, so he agrees to write and weaves the story around the characters he sees in the mall/ office. There is the Chaplinesque eve-teaser (Rajpal Yadav), the serial polygamist (Tiku Talsania), the hero who is also a salesman in the mall (Chirag Thakkar) and his heroine, the food court head (Shilpa Anand). There’s also a weirdo (Sanjay Mishra), who keeps a bunch of official ID cards and butts into people’s lives.  movie  The film is not about whether Masoom can deliver his script in time. It’s more about him discovering the lives of the characters around him, which takes up the entire first half. It would’ve helped if the humour hadn’t missed the mark almost all the time. The jokes are mostly film industry-related, which is trivia that someone who isn’t from the industry can hang on to. That’s literally the only takeaway.  The story does show promise in the second half for a brief moment and there’s a decent twist, too, that one could genuinely not foresee. However, the snail’s pace at which the story moves and its two-dimensional execution, weighs the film down completely. Om Puri looks as if he’s just going through his lines to get the whole thing over with soon. In the end, his character does get the perfect story and the perfect end for his film. But do the actual audience get anything even close to that? Barely.

However, Mahayoddha Rama looks like a start in that direction. The only sad bit is, the film is eight years too late (it was made in 2008).  movie  Narrated from the perspective of the antagonist Ravana, it shows how the demon-king tries to defeat Rama and hilariously fails every time. The USP is the ten heads of Ravana, each voiced by different actors, including Gaurav Gera, Roshan Abbas, Ameen Sayani, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Kiku Shardha and Gulshan Grover, who has lent his voice to the main head. This point is exploited effectively for comic relief, though the humour is quite juvenile. Kunal Kapoor is spot on as Rama and so is Jimmy Sheirgill as Laxman. But Ravana is the most interesting character here.  With a generous dose of pop-culture references, the film scores on dialogues. Still, at 106 minutes, there’s not enough time to tie all loose ends. The animation, which is slick, is interesting only in parts, including the opening scene that shows Ravana meditating, and the final battle.  The movie is purely for kids, because it doesn’t offer much in the way of narrating Ramayana differently to grown-ups. Considering it was made eight years ago, the animation is good. However, in 2016, it leaves you wanting for more.

Sahil Anand of Roadies fame is better as the narrator and Harsh Nagar’s baby faced husband act gets a few chuckles. Shaloo Singh smiles more than she acts, and her role is confined to being the proverbial pretty face. The climax is a let-down, as the makers try and use a lot of twists in a single story and go for a serious overkill.

As if that isn’t unbelievable enough, there emerges proof, in the form of an age-old letter signed by Emperor Humayun, to back the claim.  movie  The hullabaloo draws media attention and puts pressure on the government to resolve the dispute. A jail-mantri named Visarjan Yadav, the Chief Minister, the leader of the opposition, a top-cop and a social worker; all of them get involved and this, as expected, leads to more problems than solutions. The film then follows the beaten path; one that involves clichés and used-to-death situations.  Ever since the film starts, one thing is clear that there’s an underlying motive behind Tukaram and Sundari’s actions. But the filmmaker conveniently keeps that reserved for the climax. Not that the motive explains much but well, at least we get to know the makers’ reason behind making us endure the 100-odd minutes of illogical genius.  As the protagonist, Shreyas goes overboard with forced-humour. His Marathi manoos impersonation doesn’t help things either. Manjari looks beautiful but falls short when it comes to showcasing her acting chops. Hemant Pandey gets his act right though.  Wah Taj aims to put focus on the pitiable conditions of farmers and the devil-may-care approach of the government machinery. The end result, however, is a film that has its heart in the right place but nothing new to offer. A few scenes, like the one in the courtroom, stand out in this otherwise average attempt. You can risk watching it once.

Just as he joins his childhood idol's gang, enters the love of his life, Megha (Madalsa Sharma). Some eve teasing and a song later, we're not sure if Megha hates Badal, as she claims in the film, or whether she's mad at him, as she claims in the songs. But her father, Sharmaji (Shakti Kapoor), is definitely miffed and approaches Bachcha Babu to keep the eve-teasing Badal away from her. This is a bad move on Sharmaji's part, as Bachcha Babu turns out to be an unknown devil to Badal's known one, and has now has developed some serious hots for Megha. Nothing will stop him from marrying her; consent be damned! He beats Badal senseless, leaving him to die on the outskirts of the city and goes on preparing for his wedding. But Badal isn't easy to kill as he returns from the dead. He crashes the wedding reception of Megha and Bachcha Babu, singing and dancing, and rescues the bride, courtesy a single stunt-jump and a wheelie. They both run away until they're caught up at the film's climax, which is supremely guessable.  movie  Yogesh Kumar is promising as a cocky goon in certain scenes in his Bollywood debut, but the weak story with even weaker dialogues, doesn't allow the young actor to do much. Similar is the case with Madalsa Sharma. Jimmy Sheirgill refurbishes his act from Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster. It's a joy to see Shakti Kapoor as a victim, and not the oppressor for once, and he does a decent job. Hrishitaa Bhatt has more of a cameo than an actual role in the film, as Bachcha Babu's poetry spouting wife.  The only saving grace is the film's length, which at 110 minutes, keeps your head from going 'sanki'.

A charred, mutilated and buried corpse is found in the woods somewhere near Mumbai. The police commissioner gets an anonymous phone call with some more leads and deploys two senior investigating officers Abhishek (Indrasish Roy) and Payel (Mumtaz Sorcar). The duo arrests socialite Ishani Banerjee's (Mahima Chaudhary) driver Ram Charan (Rajesh Sharma) in an illegal arms-dealing case and he spills the beans about his employer's plan to bump off Reena (Riya Sen) - Ishani's daughter. Based on the driver's confession, the cops arrest Ishani and in the investigation room, the film takes a detour to Ishani's past (played by Riya again).  movie  From here on, the film does a back and forth between Ishani's abused past and glitzy but solitary present. The film culminates after the police arrest Victor Banerjee (Sudip Mukherjee) - Ishani's media baron husband.  There are multiple sloppy moments in the film. The chase sequence in the beginning, the blunt English conversation between the TV news anchor and his guest, use of some hideous filters to portray flashbacks - the list is endless. The film, in a word, lacks subtlety.  However, there are quite a few high points too. The flashback of Ishani's past, portrayed by Riya, and her abusive, foulmouthed, rapist stepfather Sumanta Mukhopadhyay, is truly unsettling.  But the masterstroke in the film is the Roshomon-esque treatment of the confession sequences of Ram Charan, Ishani and her second husband Shadab (Shataf Figar). All three tell their own version of the same story and the director knits them together suitably.  The performances, like the rest of the film, have highs and lows. Mahima Chowdhary, practically the backbone of the film, is very convincing as Ishani. In fact, her broken Bengali too goes well with the essentially snob character she plays. Shafat Figar too has done a smart job as one of Ishani's husbands and an accomplice to the murder. The conflict and helplessness of his character are nicely shown. Indrasish and Mumtaz look good as kickass cops. Their compatibility was perhaps the sole consistent feature in the film. However, their swearing is not seamless. They appeared to be forced on their diction.  Two performances need to be noted here. One is that of Kaushik Sen. He plays the role of numbskull but maliciously cynical first husband of Ishani. He is excellent in his limited screen presence. And there is this curious case of Riya Sen. As the young Ishani, Riya is outstanding. She portrays the intricate and brittle character brilliantly. However, it seems her acting skill takes a nosedive as Reena. She looks and acts like a plastic doll with absolutely no nuance in most of the second half of the film.  The film looks like a docu-feature where most of the story is based on reportage. The case in point is sub-judice, hence there was little room for insight. However, the Sheena Bora murder case was devoured by the common people in this country. This frill-free film can be seen as a visual chronicle of the covetous, rare and bloody real-life drama."},{"Name":"Yea Toh Two Much Ho Gayaa","Release Time":"Sep 6 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Jimmy Shergill, Arbaaz Khan, Pooja Chopra, Bruna Abdullah","Director":"Anwer Khan","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Scenic locales, beautiful ladies, comedy and action; Yea Toh Too Much Ho Gayaa (YTTMHG) has everything that goes into making an entertainer. Yet, it doesn't really entertain.  movie  Mann (Jimmy) is looking to make it big in Thailand but after the encounter with the gangster's (Arbaaz) younger brother, his life is at risk. His girlfriend Tina (Bruna) convinces him that in order to escape the gangster's wrath, he must go back to India. On the other hand, Mann's twin brother Mohan embarks on a mission to bring his brother back to India too. Call it coincidence or a chance turn of events (or lazy scripting), while Mann lands in India to meet his brother and mother (Zarina), Mohan ends up in Thailand. Now, both the brothers have to resolve problems plaguing their lives, only, by swapping identities.  Many might consider watching Jimmy Shergill in a double role a treat, but even the talented actor (multiplied by two) can't salvage a film that's predictable. Unlike most of his other films though, Jimmy gets the girl this time. But to ensure that, he has to do something he's clearly uncomfortable with - dance.  Arbaaz Khan maintains the same expression throughout. Bruna Abdullah and Pooja Chopra just add the glam factor and nothing else to the film. Patchy editing and stereotyped characters hamper YTTMHG further.  The film suffers from a wannabe syndrome. It wants to do a lot but only ends up making the viewer say 'Yea toh too much ho gaya'.

They pick fellow revellers on the way and they all become one big family in no time, thus inviting their share of conflicts and sacrifices. Sadly, none of it touches your heart.  movie  Shailendra Singh pays tribute to his own baby, the annual 'Sunburn' festival here by stressing on it's popularity and aspirational value. It's the only activity on the bucket list of the central character here. Sadly, the festival is way cooler than this shoddy promotional vehicle for it and deserved a better film.  To begin with, the movie claims to be based on actual events but that seems far-fetched. It's unlikely for someone in Kashmir or Himachal Pradesh to be mad about Bollywood songs, let alone Electronic Dance Music. Even if it's true, the amateur and unimaginative execution fails to convince you to believe so.  Surprisingly, none of the scenes bother to explain why Sunny's character is crazy about EDM since he was nine or who introduced him to it. The heart of the story lies in his passion for EDM, which itself isn't explored enough. The supporting characters are outright bizarre. Everyone slaps each other as a mark of friendship and girls in hot pants wearing 'BABY' neckpieces seem as inconsequential to the story as the shirtless 'Chamdi' boys.  Barring Sunny Kaushal and the old man playing Peter, everyone acts juvenile. A few scenes do evoke emotions but they too are nullified as the director opts for cheap laughs soon after. Even the music of the film fails to capture sunburn's exuberance and spirit.  Sitting through this two hour long advertisement feels more exhausting than travelling from Kashmir to Goa by road.

The pulse of the metropolis is the indomitable spirit of Mumbaikars, who rise like a phoenix against adversity, every single time. However, the much celebrated resilience is not always by choice.  movie  Ruchika Oberoi’s film explores this tangled ‘Mumbai state of mind’ through its three unique characters — a middle-aged bachelor stuck in a mundane job (Vinay Pathak), a housewife (Amruta Subhash) finding joy in tragedy and a plain Jane seeking ‘real’ love (Tannishtha Chatterjee). The three stories have little in common, except for the constant feeling of being caged and buried under societal and financial pressures. Every character seeks freedom.   Vinay Pathak’s track mocks the ‘dictatorial’ policies of posh corporates. The management assigns a special programme for its star employees, where they are forced to have ‘fun’. This one’s bound to strike a chord with most working professionals. The second track is a heartrending account of a housewife (Amruta Subhash), who heaves a sigh of relief, after her husband is hospitalised as his opinions no longer cloud her mind. His absence makes her feel worthy, for a change. Every woman who is told she won’t ever get her prince charming because she is not good-looking enough can relate to the film’s final story, featuring Tannishtha.   Poignant and melancholic, Ruchika helps you in finding your voice amidst the chaos of the city. Her vision mirrors the gamut of emotions every Mumbaikar feels at some point in his/her life. It addresses the brooding sadness that lurks in the deepest corners of our heart. While all actors perform well, it is Amruta Subhash, who stands out with her expression of quiet optimism in dire circumstances. While the execution is effective, the length of the stories may test your patience somewhere. We wish they were crisper. Overall, this one deserves to be watched for its riveting take on love, longing and loneliness.

But it does take references from criminal activities that brought the state in news.  movie  After celebrating a friend's birthday and some drunken brawls amongst themselves, seven friends retire for the night. The next morning, Lakshya (Hariharan), one of the seven, is found unconscious on the beach. During the course of further investigation, the police learn that another person from the group is found dead in the hotel but the remaining ones are nowhere to be found. The case is handed to 'super-cop' Ali Ansari (Malhotra) and Lakshya is the prime suspect. As the investigation proceeds, missing pieces of the puzzle start falling in place. Meanwhile, Lakshya convinces Ansari of his innocence but the chance arrest of a drug-lord (Bhattacharya) puts onus back on the lad.  Missing on a Weekend tries to build up, a la The Usual Suspects style. It succeeds in keeping you hooked for a while but soon gets predictable. In the process, it ends up looking like a long episode of a desi crime series. Unnecessary item songs, repetitive dialogues and shoddy editing make it a tardy watch. Plus, there are several loopholes that are left unattended to.  For a film that banks on a fresh crop of actors, there's little to look forward to in terms of performances. Karan (who is singer Hariharan's son) shows some spark but the rest of the new cast urgently needs to take acting lessons. Malhotra, a seasoned actor, who has delivered memorable performances in Black Friday and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag to name a few, plays the brooding, tough cop convincingly.  You can take your chances with this film. Even if you don't, there won't be a lot to have missed this weekend.

She decides to learn martial arts in order to protect herself and her family. She falls in love with Satya and wishes to marry him but a Hindu pandit opposes the decision. \"Your husband will die if you marry him,\" he warns. Without paying heed, she gets married to Satya and moves to the U.S, where he resides. But a chain of unfortunate events posing a threat to her husband and father-in-law's (Gulshan Grover) lives follow, forcing her to unleash the fighter within her.  movie  While the fable is well known, moulding it to make it relevant to today's times is a good thought. To see a woman kicking ass while battling the baddies in order to safeguard her family is inspiring too. Niharica Raizada fits the bill and pulls off the action scenes with conviction. The women empowerment message stands out as well.  The execution and editing, however, is choppy. Scenes look disjointed with no proper connect with each other. Songs are pointless and the actors switch on and switch off their accents at the drop of a hat. For instance, Niharica, who is said to have lived in Rajasthan all her life, suddenly shifts to saying, \"I am happy to be hiyerrr,\" the Umrican way, her thick Rajasthani dialect vanishing the minute she sets foot on the American soil. Rajat Barmecha sleepwalks through his role, looking utterly uninterested.  The bad guys - Money John and Candy (Lucy Pinder) are laughable and inconsequential. The elongated love scenes are awkward, since there is no chemistry between the lead actors. Overall, you can skip this one.

But it bites off more than it can chew. There are three love stories running parallely which is a bit too much to pull off with its lethargic writing. The characters are poorly sketched, the humour is forced (juvenile, sometimes) and the narrative lacks clarity. Director Monjoy Mukerji's impassioned treatment is heartening but his screenplay fails him. For most part, it falls prey to cliches. The freshness of its cast gets marred by the lack of novelty in the stories.  movie  It is a messy film that takes on the entire gamut of modern day relationships; there is talk of cheating wives, infidelity, boredom, indecisiveness. Frankly, there are enough themes for a television series in here. In their attempt to say too many things, the film ends up achieving little. The melodrama is kept in skimmed measures, thankfully, which is another breather.  A word of mention for the actors especially Sahil Anand, who is earnest in his bit. His co-actors Herry Tangiri, Vikram Kochhar, Nilesh Lalwani, Niyati Joshi, Divya Choksey are all confident and promising.  What's missing from the film is some genuine fun. It has all the trappings of a solid romantic flick but there is real lack of palpability in the story. The first half is hollow, as Monjoy wastes a lot of time in the build up. In the second half, the film picks up pace despite wasting too much energy on unnecessary scenes. The biggest blow to the film is the director's inability to smoothly move between one story and the other. The cut-offs are jarring and hence, you can never empathise with the characters.  Hai Apna Dil Toh Awara is naughty, peppy, sassy but too frivolous to be taken seriously.

Poor execution and bad acting makes this a mere comedic watch. There is little merit in the film's other departments to substantiate the promise of its plot.  movie Zubin (Ayaz Ahmed) is a rich kid whose family is based in Dubai. He is in an open relationship with Nivedita ( Anima Pagare) who is bogged down by family issues, primarily her drug-addicted younger brother. In the final year of their degree, the two have been given an 'assignment' on the different kinds of criminals.  Their research has to be real which includes meeting criminals and understanding their motives. But they prefer going in for a real-life experiment. The two want to place themselves in the shoes of criminals to get a better insight into their psyche. The result is inevitable - the duo get taken in by the adrenaline rush of committing a crime. The go from petty conning to theft and eventually rape and murder, to give their dissertation some palpability.  Sounds interesting? It is a tricky tale to tell. Sunil lacks conviction and that becomes apparent through the film. The protagonists fail to bring their mean streak and smarts to the table. It could've been thrilling but the narrative follows a predictable pattern. Sample this - Zubin and Nivedita dress up like a married couple and go to rob a jewellery store. Though unsuccessful, the incident goes unreported.  It is a prerequisite for any thriller to be engaging, clever and therefore, entertaining. On these basic counts, Moods of Crime fails. Its actors - Ayaz and Anima are passable. Uppekha Jain, who plays their professor and mentor, is average.  In its 115 minutes' runtime, the film feels longer than it should. The ending is simplistic, almost laughable. It is a pointless movie that reiterates how important crisp direction could prove for a thriller.

For most of us, rom-coms are therapeutic. Love Ke Funday is the exact antithesis of that feeling. It requires skillful direction to pull off a film with four parallel sub plots. Clearly, director Indervesh Yogee doesn't have the maturity to whip up a coherent narrative. He arrives with a promising premise but his sub-plots are laughable, lacking both earnestness and sharp writing.  Sample the stories - A woman is looking for marriage and her boyfriend, still scarred from his troubled childhood, refuses to walk down the aisle; another couple is leading an unhappy life because the man wouldn't quit smoking; a naive girl and a womanizer strike a chord despite their differences and finally, the last couple reiterates our faith in Karan Johar's iconic line - \"Pyaar dosti hai...\" Some of these stories are downright ridiculous and others are passable but the real problem lies in the fact that they aren't executed sincerely.  A bunch of novice actors play their parts to the gallery. Sufi Gulati and Ritika Gulati are strictly average. Samiksha Bhatnagar, Harshvardan Joshi and Rishank Tiwari are forgettable. The only actors who make a mark are Pooja Banerjee and Shaleen Bhanot. The supporting actors were dismal, some in need of acting lessons and others English-speaking classes.  The film's writing falls limp long before you invest in the characters. The story coasts along smoothly for a bit despite its contrived plot line. But the real problem happens in the second half, when the plot derails. The slackened speed of the screenplay reduces the film to an absolute slog. It is hard to be generous when you are sitting through bad writing, bad acting and a lot of bad jokes (a word of caution for the lame humour). We advise you let this one go unless you are desperate for the caramel popcorn at the theater's candy bar.

It is shocking, almost offensive, that a film that is meant to salute the spirit of Nirbhaya trivializes her story. At best, Murder Madhuri is a silly film. Having a script is a little too much to ask for from a B-grade movie but this one upsets more because of the grave issue at the heart of it. The noble intention of the makers is never translated on screen. Instead, it ends up being a loud, noisy and overdramatic movie besides being an absolute bore. movie You could sit in the hope that the story at some point starts taking its theme a little seriously but alas, with every passing scene it deteoriates. It is tastelessly done, its tempo is sporadic. The actors deserve a special mention for hamming to the tee. They alternate between throwing heavy-duty dialogues at each other and sleepwalking through their parts. We understand the men in the film are meant to be lecherous but they make you feel disgusted, quite triumphantly so. (Feel free to count this point in their favour if you deem right)  Jiya Khan is abysmal but you can't fault a novice when seasoned actors aren't doing their job right. Be it Indra Kumar or Raza Murad or Sharad Saxena, they are both positively terrible in their poorly-sketched parts.  A film this bad can only be blamed on lazy direction. How else can you justify the puerile streak in a movie of this nature? Director Ali Mohamed Oosman's inexperience shows in his inability to tell his tale sensitively. It is possible that writer Yerramsetty Sai's story wasn't half-as-bad but in execution, it loses meaning. By the climax, it is hard to keep your eyes open. Spare yourself the ordeal of sitting through this mind numbing movie.

The most befitting word for it would be - warped. This film starts off as a romantic drama but by the climax, it is too convoluted to get you to even care for its characters. A budding photographer and his muse have a stormy love affair. She is smitten by him, dreams to marry him and hopes for a blissful life together. He wants to be an undefeated achiever who wants to win, by hook or my crook. Marriage, for him, is the passport to a better life.  movie  Director Anil Ballani's concept has promise. His hero is not the quintessential good, idealistic, loving man. He has grave daddy-issues. Being an opportunist is ingrained in his psyche. But Adhyayan fails to deliver an adequately nuanced performance. He could have given Adi some heft and depth, but instead he keeps makes him dull. His grim expression seldom changes, but he does manage to wear his arrogance with a striking nonchalance. His brooding personality gets too tedious. Sara Loren lacks the innocence that should've been the pre-requisite of her character. The leads have no chemistry at all, which is why you never feel invested in their love story.  In the second half, there is a needless legal battle which will wear your patience thin. The charges under which Adi is framed is plain lame. He is ostracized, professionally and personally. His pitiable state does make you feel sorry for him but he never evokes sympathy.  Neither emotional, nor impactful, Ishq Click is a futile watch. Feel free to waste your hours if you deem right.

Instead of glorifying them, he unravels their flawed side. These youngsters are from affluent families, lacking a sense of purpose. They are losing their bodies and soul to alcohol and drugs. At its basic premise, the plot has promise. But its slim screenplay fails to delve better into the psyche of these youngsters, making the characters caricaturish.  In the opening scene, set in the sprawling lawn of a South Delhi mansion, a happy party comes to an abrupt end due to lack of good quality hash. The conversation shifts between Free Tibet Movement and hash till they are told about the magic drug that can knock you off in a puff. These youngsters are well-read, perfectly quoting Rabindranath Tagore, Jimmy Hendrix and Vikram Seth in the same breath. One might argue how the story is far removed from the reality, but Singh focuses on the faction less triumphant. They are complacent, comfortably splurging their parents' money with no remorse or regret.  movie  The director's opinionated side appears in flashes as he takes his story through unnecessary events - from meeting a hippie (Barry John) with a strange American who gives shelter to stoners to a Chipko-like movement where villagers are protesting land acquisition. He has a view on everything - politics, literature, love, freedom. No wonder the film feels crammed with information. You wish it were more coherent!  Singh makes a few pertinent remarks on this generation which is debatably described as 'a wretched blob of uppers and downers.' But the narrative remains pretentious. There is a lack of depth, be it in the characters or subplots. The acting is average and someone as high up as Barry John could've been better used.  M Cream is incomprehensible in parts, poignant in others but it is mostly a pointless movie. Though brimming with raw energy, the narrative lacks vision to use it right.

Love stories are no longer about 'bushel and a peck'. Dancing around trees (or picturesque locales as in this case) with blaring music in the background can no longer pass on as watchable. Keeping the evolving face of cinema and the contemporary context in mind, right from the first glimpse this film looks unbearable. The setting is garish, acting is loud and the newbies are definitely stuck in a wrong profession.   movie  Beginning off with a shoddy reworking of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayengey's drunken night scene with the receptionist from Jab We Met's Hotel Descent, the film takes a predictable route. The hurdles in the love story are frankly unnecessary. It has been a while since a Bollywood film decided to make an unrequited love story because of disparities in the social stature of two lovers. There is nothing wrong in watching familiar fare but dated stories are problematic.  You have no option but to surrender to the drudgery of its never-ending runtime (you'll be pay more attention to your wrist watch than the movie). The screenplay doesn't have an ounce of elan. The characters are neither endearing nor palpbale. There is a lack of good chemistry which could have proved to be a game changer. For those who were expecting big from Aamir Khan's brother Hyder; he probably has an entire lifetime of hard work to go before he can match the superstar's talent.  Post-interval, the film does its best to remain logic-free. Veterans Raj Babar and Zeenat Aman do a damn good job of sleepwalking through their roles.

More skeletons stumble out of the closet in due course that unnerve Koya. What's her hidden deal with Manav?  movie  On paper, the psychological thriller seems promising. It keeps you guessing if the characters are actually victims or sinners with ulterior motives. The anticipation of truth and a mysterious backstory keeps you hooked.  What spoils the party is the loud, shoddy and incoherent execution. The forced love triangle replete with inconsequential kissing scenes and steamy songs is unnecessary. The film tries to bite off more than it can chew. Death, depression, incest, sex, possession, too many issues are put together.  Also, poor writing and inappropriate dialogues evoke unintentional humour. For instance a psychic/ doctor explains possession by saying, \"uska 'soul weak' tha isliye uske saath yeh hua\", A guy tells a girl, \"I like your smell\" or something to that effect. The hero warns another guy for hitting on his girl by saying, \"Do ladke ek ghagra nahi pehen sakte.\"  While Johnny Baweja shows some potential, the lead actress is merely used for the glamour factor, who sheds her clothes at the drop of a hat. Manav Kaul overacts to essay a bizarre character who is suicidal, depressive and addicted to kinky sex (these scenes are tacky and bizarre to another level).  A line from the movie sums it up perfectly. \"Is ghar mein saare ke saare namuney hai.\" And as the actress says it, they all battle some 'day-will' (read devil). Also the background score is highly 'inspired' by the iconic theme music of The X-Files.

A sincere teacher and a class full of incorrigible students (who eventually have a change of heart), makes for a noble film but has nothing novel to say.  movie  Anant and his co-writer Sanjay Chauhan waste too much energy in sketching the myriad shades of the protagonist (Santoshi played by Tannishtha Chatterjee). She is everything you expect her to be - a mix of 3 Idiots' Ranchoddas Chanchad with a wee bit o' Maria from The Sound of Music. Unwaveringly idealistic, fiercely honest and unafraid of authority, she brings a new lease of life in her students. The problem here is the writing which is sincere, but banal. Tannishtha's earnest performance fails to make her caricaturish role convincing.  The narrative is subtle but doesn't focus much on the teacher-student camaraderie, which is pivotal to such a story. Neither does Anant delve deeper into Suhail's (a rich brat whose father is a top notch lawyer) journey from reckless to studious. The transformation happens abruptly sans a prelude, which is not impactful enough.  The story touches upon a few necessary themes - from teacher poaching to the excessive emphasis on coaching over regular classes - but the ideas don't find a strong voice in the movie. Their mission of portraying education as a calling and not a money-minting business gets lost in the film's half-baked execution.  Even as you lose your heart to Rough Book's intention, you can't buy the amateurish story. The dialogues are dated, the story is predictable (despite a momentary surprise towards the end) and the climax is sloppily done. The performances are charming (be it Amaan Khan, Joy Sengupta, Kaizaad Kotwal or Suhasini Mulay) but the film is forgettable.

In no way are we suggesting that the Kannada movie of the same name was a work of genius. But when dubbed and re-released in Hindi, the results are dismal. The lip sync is way out of place and the scenes are chopped noticeably. Blame it on the amateurish editing but these problems hold you back from investing whole-heartedly in the plot. movie  It is a classic 'boy meets girl and they fall in love' plot. But she is commitment phobic. After her parents split, she lost faith in the institution of marriage. In his tryst to get her to marry him, he would do anything (Read - Become a hot nurse in short clothes).  The humour is below the mark. In the scenes in which Chandan plays a woman, there are unbearable double-meaning jokes. It gets worse when in one of the film's most stretched bits the hero gets his own girlfriend jealous by pretending to be having an affair with her father.  The camerawork is bad and the screenplay in dismal. In such a scenario, the entire responsibility falls on the actors. The seniors are top notch. Bhumika Chawla, who returns after a hiatus, is cute. V Ravichandran is way more impressive than the hero himself. It is their love story that shines over that of the younger pair. Somehow the film has little to offer in terms of young refreshing chemistry. Sangeetha and Chandan fare well individually but don't show enough of their magical spark that could've helped the romcom swell.  If you at all want to watch this film, go for the original. The dubbed version is no fun.

Director Nagesh Kukunoor's Dhanak reminds us of the small joys of life and teaches us a lesson in dealing with our sorrows. Who better to learn this from, than kids? Nagesh's keen understanding of human emotions comes handy as he makes the young Pari his protagonist. Her world revolves around two things - her baby brother and her love for Shah Rukh Khan.  movie  Every day after her aunt hurls bitter remarks at them, the duo leaves home for school, weaving a fictitious story around their favourite actors - hers is SRK, his is Salman Khan. Nagesh plays on the rivalry between SRK and Salman's fans with subtlety. Their cute banter about who is better of the two is endearing. There is this particularly funny scene in which the kids meet a truck driver who too likes Shah Rukh. As he and Pari strike up a conversation about the many shades of the charismatic actor, Chotu stays loyal by shutting his eyes, closing his ears and rambling - 'Mujhe maaf kar dena Salman bhai...'  Such scenes are abundant but this is one of those rare times when Nagesh's writing runs out of steam. The screenplay is a weak brew that relies solely on the humour of its sharp dialogues and the charm of the child actors. Hetal Gadda and Krrish Chhabria are crackling together and it is their camaraderie that shines when the film doesn't.  Even though Dhanak stays mysterious till its last scene, it gets too repetitive to hold your interest. Its soulful music, heartfelt style of narration and of course, delightful kids can't make this half-baked story soar.

How sensitive are we to their abject poverty and hapless situation? Project Marathwada takes up this noble cause as its theme but scratches only the surface. They make the issue look shockingly uni-dimensional. The story lacks depth and banks solely on the prowess of the film's accomplished cast.  The actors do a fine job of salvaging the situation. Be it Seema Biswas or Dalip Tahil, the film's supporting cast shines. But mostly, the film rides on Om Puri's shoulders. Director-writer Bhavin Wadia places him at the center of this drama. Puri rises from being a victim to a vigilante effortlessly, lacing the story with great intensity. You wish the film's screenplay had enough power to see this through to the end. But the narrative fumbles and fizzles out soon. After a point, it resembles a regular tirade against corruption with negligible material evidence to substantiate the rant.  In the second half, the story gets repetitive which ends up making the climax look convoluted. The issue of farmer suicides is not a homogeneous one but the narrative doesn't cover the entire spectrum, making it look like a simple case of cause-and-effect. The film picks on the problems but never offers a plausible solution. Is there one good-enough reason to watch this film? Certainly, its lead man who is every bit sincere. As long as the film stays with Puri, it remains engaging. An assured tackling of the story could've gone a long way in holding a mirror to the evils that plague society.

His back story is cringeworthy, the one that involves a young boy coming to terms with his sexual orientation, a father with massive anger management issues and a dramatic night that changed the course of all their lives. At its core, the plot has its plusses which if developed, could've made for a watchable film. But the writers fail to infuse tension and drama, making it a flat tale that lacks intensity.  movie  If you have watched a handful of good films, you can surely spot the climax from a distance. But that doesn't spare you the horror of sitting through a bland story about a hapless cop, who needlessly weeps and bawls and lacks the smarts that his job entails. His relentless search for Fredrick starts abruptly and though there is enough talk about the man looming large over everyone, his mention lacks menace.  The film wastes too much time in dramatizing the minimalist story. The zoomed-in frames of blood dripping and men being shot point blank are too gory for taste. The sets are gimmicky, the frames are tacky and the acting is far from impressive. Even as Prashant Narayanan does his best to salvage the odds, Avinash and his co-star Tuhina Butalia fail to make a mark. For a couple, they barely have any chemistry and the surge of lame romantic songs can't save them. Blame it on the incoherent screenplay, if you come out with the feeling of having dumbed down in its painful two hours  For those who survive, a dialogue from the film will resound - 'Sometimes stupid things work'.

But her story is equally dull.  movie  Director Surya Lakkoju took a cue from Karan Johar's joke about casting good-looking people and we get a hot demoness, who adds oomph to the film. It could've been easy to buy into her simmering rage had it not been for her feeble backstory. The chudail is appealing till she doesn't murmur a dialogue. Of course, no one would expect good acting in a film with such an obnoxious title but this one is so bad that it is not even good. The inane dialogues make the two-and-a-half hour's runtime unbearable, leaving you more bored than scared.  The macabre ambiance is built solely by a resounding grim voice that rants about the chudail and her secret power. Frankly, it is more of a running commentary that seems right out of a catalog, which lists down the dos and don'ts.  Good writing has never been a forte of Indian horror films. They take pride in being banal. In this movie, there are scenes lifted straight from Conjuring, Vaastu Shastra and even from Ragini MMS 2. The cardinal rule of scaring people is to avoid showing the face of the ghost. There is always a greater fear of the unknown. But that as a concept hasn't been drilled well in to the psyche of Indian filmmakers yet. We are subjected to sauce dripping faces and ridiculous looking contact lenses that even a seven-year old wouldn't be scared of. As for the actors, the lesser said about them the better.

It was a thrilling delight that never lets you get distracted. But Khel To Ab Shuru Hoga which is deemed to be a chase drama, lacks a similar strong plot. A good story and half-good actors are enough to make a watchable film. However, it is indeed unfortunate that this movie doesn't get anything right. With a cliched narrative, clunky screenplay, tacky production and outrageous dialogues, it is a lost case from the word go.  movie  What is particularly disheartening, is to see the promising Ruslaan Mumtaz reduce himself to such gimmicky parts. He was looked upon as the hope of the young brigade when his cutesy Parisian love-story Mera Pehla Pehla Pyaar impressed everyone. But in this film, it is difficult to bear him. He hams through most scenes and sleepwalks through the rest. Rohit Pathak, who slips into a grey character overacts tad much.  Writer-director Kunal Singh should have steered clear from making a thriller. He intertwines romance with robbery and mixed identity, making the story a hotchpotch. This film is the kind of boring that will make you restless.  It is also necessary in a thriller that the camerawork and the ambience helps in building the film's intrigue factor. But here, the outlandish frames seemed too jarring. Even if you'd done your best to stay invested in the daft plot, there is no support from any department. Budget or actors don't sell a film, its content does. On that count, this movie fails dismally.

And even more, to profess the truth to him. The kid, who fancies looking at adult magazines and has a crush on a girl from the neighbouring school, is shattered when he discovers why his parents are getting a divorce. Director Tanuj Bhramar whips up a charming story that effectively beats the stigma of homosexuality. He paints a poignant tale filled with warmth and some genuine sweet moments.  movie  Despite the right intent, the film isn't without flaws. The shocking revelation is made early on in the film and from then the director holds our attention by showing the picturesque view of hills, an absolutely unnecessary sequence involving a Bangali Baba ki booti and some inefficacious conversations between the father and the son. The problem lies in the fact that the writing never evokes curiosity. How does Nitin's wife deal with the secret is never explored. Neither do we figure how Shivam and Nitin magically iron out their differences.  But Tanuj makes you fall for it nevertheless. He says his story simply, with a lot of heart. Arvind Swamy's effortless screen presence redeems the faults to a great extent. Even when fumbles with Steven Davies' name to tell Shivam or when he explains to his son that he doesn't find all men attractive, he is first rate. You will be particularly amused in the scene where an acquaintance tries to zip himself up in Nitin's company and he quips, 'Don't worry. You aren't my type!' Himanshu does a good job but his meltdown doesn't have a strong-enough impact.  Dear Dad deserves a watch simply for the profound point it makes about accepting people for who they are and loving them unconditionally.

Director Vivek Agnihotri smartly raises all the right questions. Finding his muse in socialist thinking, his narrative unravels the workings of the volatile Naxalite Movement which functions aggressively in the sinister underbelly of society.  movie  In the first few scenes itself, Vivek makes it apparent that dark ages still prevail in Bastar (the Naxalite safe house). But his story is set in a posh business school, far removed from the real stage of action. His protagonist, Vikram, who calls himself a 'quirky f**cker' is far from being a fitting hero. His knowledge of the issue at hand comes from flipping the pages of his professor's research file. He gives tall speeches about corporate drones who don't want to change the world. \"Make your minds your guns and your thoughts your ammunition,\" he roars at a student meet. It is quite ironical that exactly a scene later, he takes a step backwards after being called a Maoist sympathizer.  In second half, the film loses plot. Heroes turn into deceitful villains and Maoists are thirsty for the blood of a young college-goer who is practically of no consequence to them. Vivek wastes far too much time in vilifying the Naxal soldiers as anti-social elements. His limited knowledge of the issue is evident from the tendency to overfeed information. By the climax, Vivek is fumbling to put across what he set out to say. The film ends on a hurried note, never offering a plausible solution to any of the listed problems.  While Arunoday (despite his jarring accent) and Anupam Kher are good, the flimsy story fails them.

With the imagery of lush greens fresh in our minds, the poor CGI work of this film is even more noticeable. As if the look of the film weren't dull enough, its paper-thin plot and poor acting is the last straw.  movie  It is touted to be an adventure tale but there is a dearth of genuine thrills in this movie. The fact that young children are deserted in the scary woods with no help never impacts the viewer. The parents' helplessness, the children's squabbles and their 'misery' feel too synthetic. Blame it on the poor acting or the lack of a solid screenplay, but the drama doesn't hit home. Even when the kids are lost in the forest or when their trusted driver doesn't return for days despite promising to be back in 15 minutes, they seem to manage just fine. Even the kids' back stories - from estranged parents to ailing grandmother - fail to evoke any emotion.  The child actors are earnest. They aren't given enough scope to be affable but they manage pretty well. Jimmy Sheirgill in his gratuitous role is disappointing. Why would an actor of his stature allow himself to be reduced to a five-minute role?  It is a well-intentioned movie that loses steam too quickly. There is not enough good writing to keep things moving. Devoid of any fun and excitement, it is a morose affair that can be skipped! "},{"Name":"Santa Banta Pvt.

You wish it were one of those gems from the so-bad-it-is-good variety of films. But there's no respite for viewers in this utterly foolish snoozefest. Club Dancer is plain bad. It is one of those garish B-grade films without a story that features drama school rejects as actors. Outlandish set up, loud dressing and terrible acting, there is not one element that is right about it.  movie  A criminal lands up at the doorstep of a club dancer who demands marriage in return for providing shelter. The screenplay is scattered, the story is contrived and the dialogues are laughable. Almost everyone associated with this movie need an acting course on their resume.  Besides a string of novices being passed on as actors, there is Shakti Kapoor, looking visibly embarrassed about being in the film. Like the rule book suggests, seniors get in their effortlessness in every frame. He does too, with a little help from Zarina Wahab, but this is the kind of film, even the greatest acting legend would have trouble salvaging.  It does try to humour us with its unintelligent and unintentional comedy, but that too loses steam in a while. What you are left with is the arid narrative that is devoid of anything which remotely makes sense. Newbie Nisha Mavani who dons the titular role puts up a dismal show. Lead man Rajbir Singh is busy romancing his bulging biceps. He takes narcissism to another level and the makers got that quite early on in the film. That is the only logic why he spends more time romancing his muscles than the heroine. Aryan Vaid, once a popular television face, plays a cop in the film and looks rather grim about being in it. (Understandably!)  Infomercials are better produced than this wreck of a movie.

Vikram Bhatt's Love Games tries to be a tempestuous tale about temptations. But his bright concept is far from being well-fleshed out. There were a bunch of interesting ideas which never intertwine with the narrative.  movie  The characters have unconvincing issues. Mommy problems are the foremost - Sam's mother ran away with her lover and Ramona's mother allowed her to get molested, which is what justifies their promiscuity. Sam's love interest Alisha is a much-married surgeon in a physically abusive relationship. She has held on to her marriage because she eloped against the wishes of her family. Apparently no one registers a case against her beastly hubby because he is a top notch criminal lawyer. How unfortunate that no one thought of the Women's Commission or for starters, telling her parents! #EgoGames  A story about carnal exploration cannot rely just on dialogues like 'I have missed your lips'. On paper, it would've been a crackling story about lustful femme fatale obsessed with her boy toy, unwilling to part with him even when love comes calling. But when you see, an annoyingly screechy Patralekha shriek her lungs out, shooting her lover, you are as baffled as the expressionless Gaurav. While her co-actors overdo their job, Tara suffers the brunt of a badly written character. Who knows, what she could've done.  The oohs and aahs are limited to the pain of watching the film. This one is an opportunity lost. Even the brightest of ideas go in vain because of bad execution. Love Games is a classic example of it.

So technically, this is not Pawan Kalyan's Bollywood debut.  movie  Dubbed versions often evoke unintentional humour stemming from bizarre translation. Likewise, the dialogues are the only fun element here. For instance, the villain threatens the hero by saying, \"Tumhe maarna mere liye itna aasan hai jaise chai mein sugar cube dalna.\" There's more. He refuses to meet Gabbar for a strange reason. He believes, \"Woh Ek 'employee' hai Aur aise insane ko Milna Humara insult hoga.\" The jobless princess, who wanders around in pretty clothes, proudly tells her nanny, \"Mujhe ek mard ne bachaya tha\" (referring to Kalyan). The hero too spouts gems like, \"Mere jaisa ladka tumhe Google pe bhi nahi Milega.\"  Like a true power star, Kalyan makes a heroic entry (he rides a horse in slowmo with his name in capital letters being flashed alongside on the screen). You immediately assume that this will be yet another masala potboiler made to please the masses. However, things go downhill from there.  The movie puts you to sleep despite its loud execution with its yawn-worthy monotonous shenanigans. While the fans can still overlook it, the major drawback of the film is its length. Running for almost three hours, the tedious film is infested with never-ending songs that test your patience. Lack of story is the final nail in the coffin.  To sum it all, Gabbar says \"main Jo bhi bolta hu woh FIR bunjata hai.\" Like the dialogue, this supposed comedy seems equally inconsequential. Whatever Kalyan says or does seems to have become a feature film.

You can predict the crime and the climax but watch it anyway. The story is excessively cliched but sincere performances and storytelling makes it watchable. Despite having elements like prostitution and crime, much to our relief the execution is earnest and makes you care for the protagonist. Rajshri Deshpande's understated portrayal of Gauri is probably the strongest point of this film. On the contrary Brajesh Tiwari is annoyingly over-the-top.  movie  What also doesn't work for the film is its lack of continuity. Few scenes are cut abruptly and there is a lack of consistency as far as the intent goes. The social drama turns into a social awareness campaign about HIV towards the end, which seems out of context. The story too suffers as after the initial build-up, the film wanders aimlessly instead of unfolding in the manner you expect it to.  Mumbai Central raises warning signals for people, who get carried away easily and get conned in the process. The subject addressed is crucial, only if the story was not as erratic and done to death. What also bothers is the generalisation. One would rather lead a peaceful and unambitious life in village than make money in the big bad city of Mumbai. You are bound to meet good and bad guys everywhere!  As a journey of a woman's endurance and fighting spirit, Mumbai Central works. As the film, which makes Mumbai look like a monster, it doesn't. Too many inconsequential plot developments dilute the message somewhere.

Without undermining the sheer power of the visual medium, one can safely say that in 2016, Santosh Sivan's Malayalam hit from 2011 - Urumi - doesn't work. The primary reason is that the film's Hindi dubbing is laughable. It runs down the power of this revenge saga.  movie  The plot transports us back in time to the 15th century. The movie's historical referencing appears to be skewed. Certainly the creative liberties have been stretched too far, but the performances make up for it.  Genelia D'souza and Nithya Menen are both fantastic. Prithviraj is first-rate. His anguish is evident in his intense eyes. Only if his dialogues did justice to his fine depiction of the character. He is menacing and blood-thirsty but the Hindi words are rather inadequate to sum up his feelings well enough. The biggest spoilsport in the film is indeed its dubbing. Even Prabhudheva's spunky repeartee is lost in translation. Clearly, the crisp Malayalam dialogues haven't found worthy counterparts in its Hindi release.  In terms of action, way back in 2011, Urumi was a trendsetter. But with the likes of Bahubali redefining visual extravaganza in the last year, Ek Yodha Shoorveer doesn't display enough mindblowing stunts. Ever since SS Rajamouli has introduced us to that pathbreaking scene of a headless torso collapsing, it would take something magnanimous to get us raving. The action in this film is good but we've definitely seen better!  Essentially, Ek Yodha Shoorveer is a simple story about unsung heroes who have got lost in the pages of our history books. However, the staggering runtime and disastrous dialogues makes this one difficult to stomach. It could have been a masterpiece, but five later, the film feels dated. Watchable but never half as engaging as the original.

Global Baba has the smarts but never shows us anything we haven't seen before. The promising Abhimanyu Singh (of Gulaal fame) is a politico's top henchman who survives a police encounter. The safest bet for him is to turn into a Godman. He wipes out his past and hides his misdeeds behind the garb of his saintly cloak.  movie  This is such a dependable plot that never loses context. Religion in India has always been a sensitive subject. Despite being a religiously diverse country, we never want to seek logic in our faith. In a wonderful scene, director Manoj Tewari explains how the masses are conditioned to buy into blind faith over logic. When Sanjay Mishra, who pays a local hero in the film, suggests yoga to an obese man, he doesn't take it kindly. Global Baba manages to 'cure' him by suggesting that he walks to a hill-top while chanting some magical words. The humour in that scene pinches you back to reality.  But the director's sharp thinking is limited to the film's plotting. It eventually becomes an overwrought tale that hardly has anything novel to offer. The characters are all uni-dimensional and cliched - The Godman is sheer evil, the politicians are all scheming and corrupt, the cop is just rendered helpless, the journalist ends up being a victim and the masses, gullible.  The issues addressed are equally run-of-the-mill. Global Baba's ashram is on a land he has snatched away illegally from the adivasis. Every character is predictable and so is the film's story. Only in parts, the movie manages to hold your attention.  Global Baba is subversive but doesn't have an inventive streak. It points out problems without delving deeper or providing a solution. This one is just old wine in an old bottle!

Anyone who has the patience to survive this, deserves a gallantry award. When our hero - Murari makes his first entry, the whole village is seen avoiding him. The same point is driven home repeatedly, till it becomes a long running gag. He doesn't suffer from any particular mental disorder. Despite repeated suggestions, the villagers prefer taking him to a 'tantrik' than to a doctor.  movie  There is a needless love/friendship track, when the protagonist falls in love with an American girl named Jenny. The romance is hardly a value-addition to the story. Besides the fact that the story is scattered, the main problem with it is that the characters seem far from real. From the word go, you are bored to care about any of them. Even Murari, the protagonist, is more annoying than affable. Even when the film reaches its climax and tilts in his favour, you are beyond caring.  The climax has a human twist which is hard to buy. Murari's 'madness' is redeemed by his noble work (that is best reserved for the film). But the most heart-breaking thing here is that actors par excellence are meted out unfortunate parts. You feel bad to associate a veteran actor like Asrani as a part of such a forgettable cast.  As you battle dreariness while watching the movie, it is hard to not ponder about the quality of cinema in our country. Has it really improved?  Murari The Mad Gentleman doesn't deserve to be called a film. It is an amateurish compilation of bad screenplay, terrible dialogues and dreadful performances. Due to the lack of better adjectives describe the movie, it would be strictly advisable if you give this revolting so-called-work-of-art, a miss.

It is hardly appealing in the first hour but with solid performers like Vicky Kaushal and Manish Chaudhari, the film soars over its runtime.  movie  It is the kind that takes a while to brew. Its story about a young man harbouring a big dream is hardly novel. Director-writer Mozez Singh laces the build-up with mystery, but it eventually is just a mirage. It culminates into a climax that is hardly suspenseful. But by the last scene, something about the film manages to pierce your soul.  It is presumably the palpability Vicky gets on screen. His natural stammer, the way his face lights up when he meets his idol, his desperation to prove himself and mostly the despair on his face when he is pushed into self-doubt is earnest. Manish matches it with his prowess over the art. He is minimal with the words and majestic with his expressions. The rest of the cast never come close to these two in terms of performances.  The musical is high on drama. Juxtaposed with the track of a father-son duo who is struggling to acknowledge each other, is the one of a son who is fighting ghosts from the past with the help of his Babaji's music. The only track that doesn't work here is Dilsher's love story with Amira (Sarah-Jane Dias), which is jarring. They have zero chemistry and the film could have done without the romantic element.  When the plot fumbles, production takes over. Swapnil Sonawane's camerawork is worthy applauding. The production quality is far superior than most movies of recent times.  Zubaan might test your patience but it is heartbreaking in parts. Luckily, the melodrama is kept at bay even when the protagonist finds himself divided between materialism and mirth.

The lead actress' American Hindi (she is an American artist of Indian origin for real) and the hero's stalker like characterisation fails to blend with the tale. Also the story goes in circles, with no intent to proceed at all, making it a dreary love triangle.  movie  Given the title, one would expect the film to stress on its music but even that's not the case. While the heroine is constantly shown penning lyrics for new songs to be performed by their band at an intercollegiate competition, she practically sings the same song every time.  Pakistani actor Adil has potential but his 'clingy lover' character, does little to help him showcase his talent. He only spouts metaphors about life, a trait which instantly brings his desirability quotient to zero. For instance, feeling apologetic about replacing a friend in the band, he consoles him by saying,\"Main tumhari jagah kaise le sakta hu. Kabhi kabhi blue jeans ke saath white shirt nahi milta toh blue se hi kaam chalana padhta hai.\"  The supporting actors perform better. The ones who play Reet and Rajveer relatively look and sound real.  Also, you keep wondering why random goras are placed in every frame, who are not related to the story whatsoever. A college bully happens to be the villain here, who is equally inconsequential and ineffective.  Editing is abrupt as a crucial dance performance and a bike race have been bypassed. Dialogues are poorly written as well.  The love story in Rhythm is believable, chemistry likeable but the execution lacks substance.

It is regressive, silly and incoherent. This love story is overwrought and sinks due to a whirlpool of regressive ideas that forms the basis of this story. In the very first scene of the film, we find a young guy seeking love counselling from a jyotish who tells him his first marriage will end in divorce. That one scene is what determines the course of the narrative.  movie  Director Saandesh Nayak's understanding of an enlightened, empowered woman is inappropriate. She is apparently a bully, can't make her own coffee and gets guilty pleasure from humiliating men who have a thing for her. The woman characters in the film are caricaturish and uses every possible cliche in the book.  There are two vital things that are missing in this film. Firstly, there is no visible chemistry between the leads. They make the journey from being strangers to lovers in no time. And next, the love story is never palpable enough. No wonder the convoluted mess fails to be heart-tugging.  Added to that, even the actors fail to up the tempo of this snail-paced film. Anuj Sachdeva and Nidhi Subbaiah are average. With such inert characters, that is the best it could have been. The sidekicks are annoying and add no value to story.  Over its 122 minutes, Love Shagun feels longer than its length.

Director KD Satyam gets ambitious with his story, which has its heart in the right place, but fails to mould it into something impactful. Bollywood Diaries is one of those rare films that you would want to invest in but the half-baked narrative is not successful in holding your attention. It is adequate but not evocative enough.  movie  Satyam wants to say it all, even when the film's writing is incapable of supporting his vision. His respective stories -- of a Sonargachi brothel worker with her dream to romance cinema, a family man, well past his prime age, who is stuck in a mechanical job and wants to go to Mumbai to pursue a career in acting and a youth so consumed by his love for cinema that he turns deviant - don't converge. The characters' overwhelming love for the silver screen binds the stories together.  The plot itself is generic and familiar. There is hardly any novelty in what plays out on the screen. But the actors do their best make you buy into it. Ashish Vidyarthi, especially, is first-rate. His character is a manifestation of men who are stuck in a rut with their desires crushed due to family responsibilities. As ridiculous as his punar-janam yag seems, he evokes sympathy. Raima Sen is sincere but her character is not well fleshed out and that fails her track. Salim Diwan doesn't impress much except for the climax.  In this country, the glam world permeates into every sphere of our lives. Behind the shine of stardom, there is the struggle of multitudes, who are unable to make it big here.

Bubbling with fresh ideas, with the advantage of its novel perspective, it clearly had potential. But, the film is run down by its weak storyline. The musical romance that brings two people together from different worlds, who bond over music, falls flat when neither the performances nor its music soar high enough.  movie  A music producer from erstwhile Mumbai, Vibhavari (Sugandha Garg) embarks on a soul-searching journey. The film is romantic but not in the quintessential way. Its soul draws from romance but not in the sense that we understand. Quite early in the film, we get a hint of Vibhavari's empty life. Her trip to Punjab to find a folk singer named Bibi Saroop, plays a significant role in helping her character evolve. There is a clear lack of maturity in the film's writing. The lead characters are half-baked and their supposed love story is left to your imagination. While on one hand, you are compelled to appreciate the subtlety of the screenplay, it is infuriating to see the tempo run out by the final scene.  Vibhavari's love story with Mastana (Sidhant Behl) is confusing. What transpires between them through the film is left on an abrupt note in the last scene.  Shefali Bhushan does a novice's job at helming the project and uses music and beautiful locales to salvage the scene. Bulle Shah's lyrical verses come alive with Vishal Bhardwaj and AR Rahman's rendering. But even in the music department, it isn't path breaking.  Despite its freshness, the film fails to create an impact. It is hard to be affected by it due to its lack of depth.

Nor does it touch upon the controversies that the late guru was supposedly embroiled in.  The biopic strictly deals with Osho's early years (1938-1952), at the time when he was yet to become famous. This is his coming of age tale.  movie  It gives you a glimpse of his growing up years with grandparents in Madhya Pradesh, his evolving psyche, aversion to conformity to norms and formation of independent philosophies. It traces his spiritual journey and revolves around his curious and inquisitive mind.  Hooda deserves to be appreciated for not making the film look like a propaganda vehicle. Fortunately, the guru is not presented as the MSG-esque superhero. Unhurried, peaceful and meditative, the treatment is therapeutic. However, you wish the film had delved deeper and would have been far more profound in its approach. The story seems preachy in places and execution, oversimplistic.  Considering, this is just the first part and next installments might cover the latter life of the guru, it's sincere if not satisfactory an effort.

Made with an intention of showcasing the worms in the current education system, where money often gets merit over capability; this film can be lauded to some degree. However, it flounders in the first half due to its tacky narrative approach. Told like a TV serial, it takes the oft-taken path of following the underprivileged on local train rides to the Mumbai chawl. Okay so the point of a teacher's life being hard is made. Yet, it's predictable to see Shabana dabbing sweat with her sari pallav as she gets off an over-crowded Virar local, buying vada pav and keeping the positive spirit at home that has a handicapped husband (Girish Karnad) and their about-to-be chartered accountant daughter. The revered teacher also coaches the neighbourhood children for free!  movie  Then, there is Juhi who is slightly more privileged than her didi, Shabana. She can buy a car on installments. These two teachers also have hardworking colleagues, who become sisters in misery when Kamini Gupta(Divya Dutta) a devil wearing designer sarees is appointed as the principal. Divya is more unreasonable than Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters put together. The shock of having to bear her nastiness gives Shabana a heart condition. Juhi exits the school and vows to get back the 'honour' of her didi and herself. So, they reach out to a media person, Richa Chadha, an IAS officer, a Minister, conscientious past students from the world over and even win Rs 5 crore in a KBC-styled contest, with Rishi Kapoor in a cameo as the quiz master!  The execution for the most part is clumsy. Yet somewhere in the second half, Gilatar redeems himself and the film. He touches on the importance of teachers in our lives and shows the apathy of the powers-that-are towards providing equal education opportunities. It also gives us a proud India moment as we watch two teachers pass a GQ contest with flying colours. Life, after all, whether in a cinema hall or on the outside is about minor triumphs (staged or otherwise), isn't it?  Shabana and Juhi are irritatingly saccharine initially; but get firmly in the saddle soon. They're from the dependable lot of actresses after all.

Adorable","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"1 hour 37 minutes","Review":" It is admirable that Chhota Bheem Himalayan Adventure stays as thrilling in a 90-minute film as it does in its half-hour episodes. It might seem humble in comparison to the inventive Pixar offerings of the recent past like Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur, but it wins on many counts. Benefiting from being an intrinsically desi story that captures the flavours Indian kids have grown up on, the stunts and Bheem's bahaduri has been amplified for celluloid purposes.  movie  The writing is deliberately kept conventional and focuses completely on the deeds and misdeeds of Bheem and his gang. The best thing about the movie is that it is kept crisp. At 90 minutes, it never feels heavy. With a sketchy story at its core, its animation has a rich look. The beautiful rendering of the snow-capped mountains and the ski scenes are fabulously done. It is never quite photo-real but the earnestness in the effort is hard to miss. The gripes from its previous installment stay. Overemphasising on physical prowess has always been a major issue with this cartoon series.  There is no clever spin to the plot and it takes up a predictable hero-versus-villain route. It is a simple, conventional story that is a delight for kids but it never pushes itself to further the genre. The only thing worth applauding in this largely familiar story is the emphasis on adventure sports. Thankfully, we are told all about the safety measures, even if in a tad-too-preachy voice!  Chhota Bheem Himalayan Adventure is amateurish but a roller coaster ride that entertains to the hilt. You just wish it had a little more than what we've seen in the TV series.

Despite being a well-intentioned story about the many 'isms' that plague India, the film's narrative fails to explore the dynamics of hierarchy politics that is the heart of the issue. Director Bikas Ranjan Mishra seems too distracted in his storytelling, which makes the film half-baked. You are never allowed to invest whole-heartedly in the characters. In this case, the viewer is reduced to being a mere spectator who is never entirely absorbed or overwhelmed by what plays out on screen. Atrocities on dalits in India is a subject that filmmakers have frequently attempted, but Chauranga lacks an opinionated voice.  movie  The rebel child Santu (Soham Maitra) is the only one who draws you towards the drab story. There is a visible spunk in him. His grouse towards life, his yearning for the love of his master's daughter and his irreverent attitude has a striking relatability. Soham, in the author-backed role, suffuses a refreshing energy to the plot. In a delightfully risque scene, he audaciously enters the out-of-bounds temple premises and rides the Nandi bull. In an otherwise unimpressive movie, Mishra gives us this one character to root for.  There are moments where Chauranga gives you the Masaan feel, but lacks its poetry and depth. Its women characters in this film are pitiable. Be it the dalit woman Dhaniya who has to satiate the Zamindar's lust to win her sons a ticket to a better life or his own wife and daughter, who lurk around like shadows in his mansion, the women are all singularly uni-dimensional.  Chauranga is neither provocative nor skillful in its portrayal. Though its last scene ushers in a ray of hope to nullify the haunting gory glimpses from the film, it never soars high enough to affect you.

It is a must watch, just for the sake of guilty pleasure. This garish offering takes tackiness to an altogether new high. At a time when Indian cinema is upping its game, such run-in-the-mill formulaic films are so unabashedly and confidently giving the term 'eye-sore' a new meaning.  movie  Sorry Daddy is a full-blown ham fest with unintentionally funny dialogues. The film's story revolves around the cop and how he busts a major nexus that thrives on the business of beggary. This is an outdated idea and the makers make no attempt show any flair in reinventing the concept. Using the stocks props of the genre, the film shifts between its heroes, villains and their altercations over gimmicky punchlines.  The film puts on a 70s' cloak but doesn't have the benefit of a solid story. A series of scenes sewed together in a loose narrative fails to make an impact.  The acting department puts together ludicrous histrionics in dialogues that will put Kanti Shah's Gunda to shame. Aapke wajood ka ansh mere wajood se judd gaya hai is how a woman announces her pregnancy. If you are looking for two hours of laugh-out-loud moments, resort to this unapologetic film.

The theme lends itself to a few overwhelming moments. But they are in short supply. The Silent Heroes is a perfect example of how being myopic can play down noble intentions.  movie  As the story revolves around its 13 mute artistes, we are constantly shown how people are hostile to them. This villainous vein looks like a gimmick. The film also should've ideally avoided playing the sympathy card from the first frame. It shows how as a society our psyche forces us to pity the underprivileged. Characters who emphatically reprimand people for referring to them as disabled try to even out the flaws but don't quite manage it. Also, it is a shame that we are told nothing about our 'heroes'. The 13 children are an amorphous mass and there is no effort to portray them as individuals with distinct identities and unique struggles.  The film's story shows promise but its tawdry execution is a problem. It is unpardonable that the actors in this film are either overacting or sleepwalking through their roles. Thankfully its leads - Maanuv Bharadwaj and Priyanka Panchaal are watchable but the same doesn't stand true for the other actors who reduce their characters to caricatures.  The technical drawbacks and logic lapses further weakens in the narrative. After an accident, an orthopedist is seen examining the patient's lungs. Clearly, this is the kind of laziness that hinders this film from making an impact. Additionally, the film's tone is too flat and though enough drama unfolds on screen, it never really touches you.  The victory of the underdog is cinema's favourite theme and filmmakers return to romance it rather frequently. But the formula is done-to-death and it is mandatory that writers show their inventive streak in rendering it. It is hard to not lament over how lack of finesse killed a sturdy concept.

It is both engrossing and abhorrent, addressing the issue of female infanticide with an astute understanding of the subject. Director Madhureeta Anand's story is backed by solid research and her empathetic stance allows her to dive headlong into the issue to provide a more holistic view. The titular character is a creation of the society, an institutionalized scapegoat to validate female infanticide. This is established early on in the film as Kajarya in her opium-induced state is handed over newly-born babies to be killed. In a scene much later, Kajarya says 'Mere toh bas haath hi they. Saza toh unke bachiyon ke maa-baap ne pehle hi suna di thi.' movie It is interesting how Madhureeta juxtaposes two different worlds - that ​of Kajarya's with Delhi's elite circles. The rudimentary chauvinistic thinking never ceases to follow women. Over a dinner party, Meera is told by the who's-who women 'ek ladka hi vansh ko aage badha sakta hai'.  The director smartly segregates her woman characters, and yet keeping them both equally potent and flawed. Ridhima plays Mira with a certain vulnerability, but it is Meenu whose understated performance has the menacing power. Madhureeta is sharp enough to turn moral tables and make you root for the slayer Kajarya over the aggressive 'moralistic' reporter. What are the moral ethics of journalism, afterall?  With so much going for the film, it isn't so faultless. Technical glitches aside, the story meanders in the second hour. The men are singularly villainified! You will be moved in many scenes but that doesn't culminate into a wholesome viewing experience. The characters never latch to you and hence it is easy to remain unaffected by the dramatic ending. It is unmistakably depressing and the documentary approach makes it feel like a drag.

Formula films do have their charm but this one is a mess of bad acting, worse dialogues and shabby direction. There is no excuse for lip sync issues in this day and age.  movie  Balbeer (Akkilesh Verma) loses the love of his life in a mishap. He avenges her death and gets sucked into the world of crime. While the revenge angle is justified, his transition into a don looks frivolous. The actors fail to bring any conviction to the flimsy plot, making this movie far from watchable.  The story is not well fleshed out. Two rival families are seeking revenge from each other but the narrative doesn't shed light on what really happened between them. As dirty songs and expletives take over the screen, the experience of sitting through it becomes even more traumatic. A contrived second romance that is forced into the screenplay is far from being an advantage to this vile affair.  The acting department has nothing to gloat about either. The leading lady definitely needs spoken English classes and the leading man can do with some diction coaching. His Jat twang comes out all wrong.

For Sikander, life comes a full circle when he begins training Bhuumi for her big competition. His penance adds substance to this otherwise lacklustre narrative.  For the entire first hour, the film offers oodles of melodrama. It is only in second half that the focus shifts to the race and its preparation. The story blooms only in the last 20 minutes of the movie. An underdog champion, who wins against all odds, is always something worth rooting for and that is the only thing worth cheering for in this film.  However, the actors are disappointing. Himani doesn't have the demeanour of an athlete. Mansoor overplays his part and Bhagwan Tiwari is more comical than menacing.  This film has a noble cause at heart and while we are all for women empowerment and better involvement of the fairer sex in sports, Run Bhuumi is definitely not a step forward in that direction.

The social drama intends to make people across the country empathize with the Bihari youth, because of the lack of opportunities in the state and the hurdles they must overcome to earn a dignified living. The idea is to tell why many end up migrating to other states and why the situation isn't changing.  movie  Rajiv Kumar (Kranti Prakash Jha) is a noble teacher, who wants to start coaching classes in order to gather sufficient money for his sister's wedding. His wish fails to fructify as the banks won't sanction his business loan. Shankar (Deepak Singh) is qualified to bag a government job but his inability to bribe the officers kills his opportunity. The two get exploited for being honest and hard-working. Disheartened and disillusioned, the two turn to abduction — the supposedly common crime in Bihar.  While the story is relevant, setting authentic and performances decent, the sluggish pace is sleep-inducing. Also, the second half looks like a different film in itself, with no connection to the beginning. Few of the scenes are daft. Why would three kidnappers tell their motive to the man they kidnapped!  Unless it's a documentary, when a film raises a significant socio-political issue like this, one expects it to propose logical solutions as well. This one aspires to trigger a revolution by projecting its protagonists as crusaders of human rights. Sadly, all they do is preach and then commit an idiotic crime themselves, much against their own values and beliefs.  The inability to expand the basic idea into a solid story lets this otherwise well-intentioned film down.

The background score is not in sync with the mood of the scene, usage of Urdu is limited to mashaallah, janaab and hasrat bhari nigahen.  The heroine speaks in a sickly elderly voice and hams to the extent that Rakhi's Karan Arjun act pales in comparison. She calls herself 'khubsurat' every two minutes. Faissal looks 50 and is made to act like a 20-year-old, which is disturbing. His constant angry expression comprises arched eyebrows and enlarged blood shot eyes. Physical resemblance to Aamir (especially in Fanaa) is uncanny but that is where the similarity ends. We wish the actor would have chosen a better comeback vehicle instead of this random film.

The film follows the standard Punjabi wedding film template to the T, then giving it the cliched 'pyaar dosti hai' twist to infuse novelty. The end result is so bland, predictable and juvenile that you'll probably hate the joy of weddings or the concept of love altogether.  movie  Shot in picturesque Thailand, we wish the film had a stronger content and some substance. You don't relate to or feel for any character or their dilemmas. When friends fight, they randomly take off to London. Also, while everybody keeps harping on love and friendship, they fail to evoke any form of emotion. All you see is actors with zero chemistry and acting skills singing songs, dancing, strolling on the beach, flaunting fancy wedding clothes and bikinis, flashing dimples and spouting gyaan on marriage.  As if their philosophy is not enough, you have Rishi Kapoor reprising his Love Aaj Kal character. He doubles up as the hotel manager/ love guru/ agony aunt, who only makes an appearance to give unsolicited advice. He is still the only bearable aspect of this shaadi.  Wedding Pullav seems like a never-ending wedding video of an acquaintance, you feel nothing for. It's loaded with mandatory party/ wedding songs, honeymoon jokes, friendly banter, mummiji's drama, et al. What the film lacks is heart and scrumptious food!

His tale revolves around taxi driver Farooque (Rajpal Yadav), William visa wala (Subrata Datta) and other such troubled characters that get involved with the two for money. Each has a legitimate reason to unintentionally hold the elderly man hostage. Victims of circumstances, their plan keeps going awry until truth about the man surfaces.  movie A low-key comedy of errors, the film works in the first half owing to the confusion, chase and running around. Rajpal Yadav doesn't overact for a change and manages to hold the film together. Zakir Hussain as Gali Baba is equally effective.  The film intends to send out a noble message and manages to a certain extent but gets too preachy towards the end. The never-ending moral science lecture in the climax is uncalled for and predictable. A little subtlety would have made a whole lot of difference.  A simple take on surviving in Mumbai and true happiness - you won't mind watching this one unless moral stories really bug you.

A lavishly mounted fantasy adventure, at the core it is basically a love-story.  movie  In a faraway land, live a cruel tribe who go by the name of Betals. Blue eyes and Dracula fangs are their distinguishing features. They also have strange powers that can get them to fly like Batman and fight like Gladiators. Their only aim is to commit atrocities on some poor mortals living in the plains close to their kingdom.  Don't grieve just yet. When you think that the meek are doomed for life, baby Magadheera is found floating in the water surrounding this village. He is adopted and becomes a favourite. This place is also home to a pretty lass called Pawanmali (Shruti). The two marry secretly. But their happiness is short-lived because the Jaltarang (Sudeep), the cruel Betal marshal kidnaps Magadheera's loved one. In his quest to find his wife, Magadheera sets off to the Palace where the cruel queen (Sridevi) lives with her daughter Mandakini (Hansika). Of course, his journey is hardly without adventure. Before he can ride off into the sunset with his wife, he has to fight a one-eyed monster, maim a hundred Betals and sing songs with Mandakini.  Puli is a fantasy but its failing is that it is told in an amateur fashion. Coming as it does, after the humongous success of Bahubali that raised the bar as far as fantasy, animation and give-it-all-you-got cinema goes, Puli disappoints. The film works as a visual extravaganza, but it fails to entertain. Even Vijay fans may find it hard to lap up his snazzy song-routine. Sridevi's arched eyebrows are more expressive than the rest of her. Hansika and Shruti only wiggle their backsides and shake their bellies. Aah, even that's disappointing.

That's when a genie (Vikram Bhatt) mysteriously appears and grants Johnny the privilege to live two different lives at the same time for the next 72 hours in order to decide whether he'd like to kill Tanya or save her. He lists down his three conditions as well.  movie  Thus begin two parallel tracks that unfold simultaneously. One shows Johnny killing Tanya and the other shows him rescuing her by risking his own life. What life does he choose in the end?  Though strikingly different, the moral of the story is simple - good triumphs over evil. Karma shapes your destiny.  The whole exercise of presenting these twin stories with the same protagonist displaying contrasting behaviour is interesting. However, the motive of the crime itself is too cliched and the chase has zero thrill or suspense. Instead of making you nervous, it makes you go to sleep.  To add to the existing woes are songs and lame romantic tracks.  The intention must have been to give Jason Bourne like film a sci-fi twist. Sadly, this film lacks the pace, tension or thrill of the Bourne series as well as the sci-fi adventures.  Kunal is confident, Zoa pleasant and Manasi Scott effective as a shrewd businesswoman. The stunts are decent as well. It's the story that doesn't bhaag enough. It's too stagnant and drab for a thriller.

It commands how you should behave, dress up, look or achieve. The film's curious protagonist dares to question these very norms that hound youngsters, who are often expected to not have a voice as they cannot possibly understand what their elders do. Curtailment of freedom of speech, drives Gaurav to rethink his perspective on relationships.  movie  Though Time Out initially comes across as a social commentary on today's 'elitist youth', catering strictly to the rich kids, it slowly gets deeper as it progresses. We wish the process was faster as much time is wasted in showing the teenagers' shenanigans in the international school. Their routine conversation and banter is quite authentically depicted unlike various mainstream Bollywood films but it's a tad repetitive. The film only takes off in the second half. This is when it gains momentum and proves that it has a point.  Gaurav finds out that his elder brother Mihir is gay. He is unable to accept this as he looks up to Mihir, a high-school jock whom every girl fancies. Adding to his woes, the girl he fancies friend zones him. Does he find a closure?  \"How to fix your gay kid\" is what their mother types on google when Mihir reveals his sexual orientation and wishes to come out of the closet. This is probably the best scene of the film, which sums up the hypocrisy that so called 'liberal' parents exhibit. If there were more poignant moments like these, Time Out had the potential to be a game changer.  Time Out may not have a hard-hitting story but it does make you think. Under its Richie Rich garb, lies a thought that's enlightening and liberating. Both the lead actors Chirag Malhotra and Pranay Pachauri are aptly cast.

Based on a thin, staggering plot line, it has a careless narrative which makes a mockery of its powerful theme. The film sets its bold tone right, almost as soon as it begins. But, as the narrative progresses, it jumbles up while juggling between too many ideas. What doesn't help the film's case is its lousy script, amateur acting and frivolous style.  movie  Though the movie's first glimpses were successful in grabbing eyeballs by aping famous scenes from iconic films, there isn't a hint of inventiveness in its story. What is most heartbreaking here is to see the names of Zeenat Aman and Lata Mangeshkar in the credit titles. Zeenat Aman, who plays an important part in the film, deserves a lot better than this.  Homosexuality is a raging subject today, not only in our country, but all over the world. While tackling a story this sensitive, the writers needed to be careful. But, in turn, the story they churned out is nothing short of lame. Filled with innuendos and ludicrous lines, it has nothing that works as its saving grace.  Despite being well-intentioned, Dunno Y2 is a misfire. Actors Yuvraaj Parashar and Kapil Sharma are passable is the roles of Aryan and Ashley.  But, it's problematic that the matter they have in hand is passe and isn't in-sync with the present dynamics of the issue. With homosexual marriages getting legalized in America and Article 377 coming under fiery scrutiny in India, the landscape has changed a lot since 2010 (the year of its prequel).  It is unnecessarily sensational and lacks the affable charm which could've changed the fate of this mediocre movie. There is some interesting energy to watch out for, but overall, its drama lacks the desired fervour.

Barring that, there is hardly a show of his inspired writing. A bunch of dreamy-eyed local goons creating havoc - is a story we've often explored on celluloid and has now ceased to be as inventive or impressive as before. Drawing from the baleful sphere, Quadri dishes out an insipid formulaic story that follows the routine of staple gangster sagas in Bollywood.  Ever since Anurag Kashyap familiarised us with this sinister world in Gangs of Wasseypur, filmmakers have been churning out shabby clones of it. Since Quadri has been mentored by him, the loyal protege follows Kashyap's blueprint to the tee, and knows how to add the much-needed fun to salvage his film.  movie  For the first hour, cheeky dialogues create an appealing mirage but clenched-teeth swag, unnecessary kidnappings, needless buddy fall-outs and cop chases later, you feel drained. Quadri pilfers the essence of films we've watched and loved, but fails to bring in their stirring spunk.  The primary problem here is that it doesn't remain dedicated to its central plot. The film allows its energies to meander into its superfluous sub-plots, which dilutes the drama of the story. The gang of six keep you entertained with their antics for a while, but there is a noticeable lack of intensity, which compromises the overall zest. For a crime saga, the film misses the mandatory grit.  Quadri adopts a non-linear mode of storytelling, which makes the narrative frequently lose plot. A few standalone scenes work, mostly the ones that render some comic relief, but the general lack of novelty makes it a tragic bore.  To their credit, actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Shadab Kamal score and seasoned performers like Mukul Dev and Sanjay Mishra are adept, but none can lift the movie from its banal mediocrity.  Meeruthiya Gangsters has flashes of Quadri's brilliance, but the underwhelming script squanders all potential.

It even has one of the most interesting opening scenes - a parody on the 'anti-smoking' public interest commercials that bug most filmgoers. It shows how unrequited love is equally 'hanikarak for our sehat'. Jay's take on love and relationships is intriguing. He confides in a stranger, feels connected to her more than his best friend and hopes she's the one for him, even without knowing her surname. The world keeps reminding him that the clock is ticking and it's high time he 'settles down' like normal people his age but he begs to differ.  However, what begins as an interesting tale on serendipity and conversation romance on the lines of Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), gets too philosophical to digest after a while. You wonder why two youngsters in their mid 20's harp on things like reincarnation and childhood trauma. This is where the drama loses grip and ends up becoming a conventional love story.  Lead actors Teeshay, Tara-Alisha Berry are perfectly cast as they do a commendable job, despite being newcomers. We wish the story and dialogues had more substance like its iconic Hollywood predecessors for us to feel for their characters. The film may not be 'perfect' per se but has its heart in the right place. The cinematography deserves a special mention as well.

While the lead actress (Krutika) shows promise, this wannabe Aashiqui 3 takes an unintentional comic turn with the arrival of Aditya Pancholi, who plays Swara's misogynistic husband Vitthal Dada. Funnily, no one gives two hoots about this self-proclaimed local goon. His penchant to address himself in the third person while spouting silly dialogues in incorrect Marathi makes you giggle.  movie  Giving the hilarious villain a tough competition is the film's hero. He (Bhatia) looks like a mishmash of Ravi Kishan and Hrithik Roshan, acts like Salman Khan of Bandhan and wears a cap at all times like Himesh Reshammiya during his pre hair-weaving days. His musical headshakes are reminiscent of epileptic seizures.  To add to the humour in this supposed tragic drama is the good old safari suit clad organizer (Arun Bakshi), who scouts singing talent for Mrs Narang's (Anju Mahendroo as the quintessential jobless rich woman) in-house parties. Bakshi convinces the lead actors to perform together by telling them, \"I must appreciate your chemistry.\"  However, Vitthal Dada cannot accept the fact that a woman can make money even if she isn't a doctor or an engineer. \"How can you have a job?\" he asks Swara.

Their subjects are deeply hurt by the cruelty imposed by the reigning king's father. His casteist mentality does irreparable damage. He throws the poor out of his village and forbids them from setting foot on his 'pious' soil again.  movie  Those disowned find shelter in Bairi. Years of hard work in this village finally pays off in the form of adequate food and water supply. Upari, on the contrary, disintegrates, facing drastic water scarcity. In dire straits, the king (Saurabh Shukla) begs his 'English-speaking' lawyer son (Kunal Kapoor) to woo Paro (Radhika Apte), daughter of Bairi's aspiring politician Kharu (Gulshan Grover) to regain power and lost glory.  First things first, Kaun Kitney Paani Mein must be lauded for its story book-esque narration. In a light-hearted manner, it puts forth grave issues that rural India still grapples with. Nila Madhab Panda's unique execution refrains from giving the film a socio-activist tone. Its non-preachy execution, earnest performances and constant comic undertone hold your interest right for the most part of the film.  However, the story goes haywire in the second half. While the dashing Kunal and sincere Radhika are aptly cast, their 'love story' seems a tad random and digresses from the core subject.  The dialogues are crisp. Saurabh Shukla walks away with the best lines and does complete justice to them. Gulshan Grover also holds his own and impresses in his not-so-substantial role.  The depiction of bankrupt monarchs, who choose to rest on their past laurels, is a one-of-its-kind and the prime highlight of this quirky film. In the present-day situation, where water is one of the most precious resources, Kaun Kitney Paani Mein touches upon a relevant issue but wraps it all too conveniently, without being confrontational.

Sadly on D day, Rajesh flees with another girl, leaving Baankey and his family in the lurch. They then make Virat (Satyajeet Dubey in a double role), their bus driver pose as Baankey, promising him a large sum of money. They also state that they will waive off his father's debt if he agrees. Virat becomes the proxy groom, but falls in love with Anjali for real. To make things more complicated, Rajesh shows up at the wedding too.  The film is a situational comedy, which partially works, thanks to the talented cast. The humour is clean for a change and that is refreshing. Satyajeet Dubey and Vijay Raaz in particular, stand out for their effortless performances. Tia Bajpai is pleasant, but Raajpal Yadav overdoes his 'loser' act. He hams away to glory and hugs men after every two minutes, which fails to amuse you. The plot is interesting, but the director fails to take it further, resulting in stilted gags that seem forced and repetitive.  The background score (the name Baankey keeps echoing) expects to make you laugh, but gets quite annoying eventually. The heroine falling into the arms of the hero, or her dressed as a man and few other such scenes are extremely cliched and inconsequential..

If they were to do so, they had to kill this very 'tehzeeb' which made us invincible.  movie  Cut to 1876, we are then introduced to Raja Ameer Haider (Imran Abbas), who has been raised by the British as their own, since his late parents were loyal to the company. Naive and vulnerable, the king respects the British until a local courtesan Noor (Pernia Qureshi) makes him question his views. Romance blossoms but 'fight for self-respect and freedom' takes precedence over everything else as the lovers grapple with their life-altering past.  What could have probably worked solely as a period love story keeps meandering into randomness as Muzaffar Ali tries hard to turn it into a revolutionary tale. Patriotism and fight against injustice do not fit into the overall scheme of things, leading to an uninspiring film that struggles to make sense.  Speaking of history or the beauty of the bygone era, sadly his film seems as jaded as an abandoned, dilapidated palace, which is way past its glory.

Pernia Qureshi dances well but fails to do justice to her exotic role as an actor. Imran Abbas is relatively superior.  If you are the kind, who is besotted with India's past and the beauty of Lucknowi culture, you won't mind watching this one, solely for the stunning costumes and classical music.

But, Aisa Yeh Jahaan presents you with the story of a young Assamese couple who overcome the perils of Mumbai's metropolitan culture and revives love, familial bond and companionship that was fast eroding from their lives. As the story shifts between its central characters Rajib and Ananya, they are depicted as young parents who are reeling under the staple pressures of raising a child in a big city and paying multiple loans to in order to support themselves too. Rajib has on his platter the pressing needs of his overambitious wife, whose materialistic demands are difficult for him to fulfill.  movie  Director Biswajeet Bora's characters are largely uni-dimensional, restricting themselves to just being black and white. The film's narrative is inclined towards the beauty of India's villages and small towns, but takes up a cliched method of slamming big cities like Mumbai to establish this dichotomy. Thus, Bora's judgment of the small-town-versus-big-city view lacks balance and that comes through in the film.  The movie has its heartfelt peaks but suffers from inconsistent writing. It toys with too many ideas - there is the impact of modernization on families, the monetary compulsions on city parents, bias towards people from North-East India, parents pushing their young kids into glamour for big bucks and mostly the pivotal idea of loving nature. Despite so much heart in it, it's the lack of coherence that makes the film feel half-baked.  Both Palash and Ira play their characters to the tee, with utmost earnestness. The child artistes Prisha Dabas and Kymsleen Kholie play their parts wonderfully too. However, Bora's plot is weakly brewed, often sloppily written and mostly lacks impact. The film will touch you surely, but the overall effect doesn't suffice as anything much to write home about.

People from these places are certainly not going to be pleased by their portrayal.  Also, did we mention that an elaborate scene shows these four losers giving a fashion makeover or grooming session to overweight people, when they themselves desperately need one?  We don't know what the intention behind making this 'comedy' film was. The outcome is tragic for sure.

The makers of Bezubaan Ishq certainly are. Their concept is ghastly outdated and the television soap opera-esque execution yawn-worthy. To add to the drama in the jaded love triangle, you are told Suhani suffers from a rare disorder that make her faint every time she gets angry.  movie  Supporting characters speak in weird accents and their appearance and disappearance make no difference to the plot. Slow-mo dream sequences pretty much form the whole story. Speaking of the lead actors, Ullal barely speaks and the hero is over-expressive. Godse is decent but she has nothing substantial to do.

The underlying message being - logic and reasoning take a backseat when it comes to meting out justice.  movie  Though well-intentioned, intriguing and effective in places, this satirical tragicomedy is as sluggish as the proceedings of the very judiciary it takes a dig at. The first half is wasted showing Pradhan and his sidekick (Ravi Kishan) falling for the buffoonery of a self-proclaimed godman (Sanjay Mishra). He even claims to have a cure for Pradhan's impotency. Arjun's clandestine affair with Maya and their not-so-secret rendezvous too eat up a lot of time. The film gets to the point only in the second half.  As far as comedy is concerned, lines that are genuinely funny get repeated to the point that they cease to amuse you. What is hard-hitting is the tragedy of the situation (what Arjun's family goes through) and gives some meaning to an otherwise absurd script. If that aspect was given more prominence, Tanakpur would have been a much better film.  For a satire, subtlety is what you miss. You can't possibly harp on potty jokes, describe women's breast sizes and crack jokes on rape to sound smart and socially responsible. Sadly, this social satire, which could have been an eye-opener on false cases and fraud witnesses, literally has more shit (pun intended) than substance.

Bhati","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 5 minutes","Review":" Ram (Vikrant Roy), Anil (Rohan Mehra), Vikram (Lavin Gothi) Salmaan (Mohit Baghel) and Deenbandhu (Meghvrat Singh) are good-for-nothing brats, who fool around and ogle their female colleagues and firang teachers, dressed in seductive saris. They don't pay heed to the regular punishments they are subjected to or warnings given by the school staff. However, things escalate when three of them are taken into police custody for allegedly raping their principal's daughter. The boys claim innocence. Even their school, family and friends stand by them but law must take its course and ensuring that is S.P. Tejaveer Singh (Jimmy Sheirgill). Does truth prevail?  movie  Uvaa (read youngsters) is one of those many films which touches upon a relevant topic but fails to capitalise on its potential. You fail to understand why a film, loosely inspired by the Nirbhaya case must begin as a silly campus caper. The director resorts to comedy in the first half, probably to extend the reach of his social drama across all age groups and that turns out to be a terrible decision. The supposed jokes do not amuse you at all.  The youngsters act well but sadly, poor writing lets them down. Rajit Kapoor and Om Puri are wasted. Jimmy Sheirgill's character is the highlight of the film and he is sincere and intense but you wonder why such a good actor gets restricted to such conventional roles.  Various films raise issues and portray aam junta's plight, their silent protests and outrage against the system, but fail to offer a credible solution to fight the crime. Uvaa dares to do that and manages to make sense somewhere, but shoddy execution mars this potentially significant social drama, which demands crucial changes in our judiciary and society at large.

Sarah is really concerned about her spouse Aryan's (Satiish) OCD. Nonetheless, she has a strange way of showing her compassion and concern for him. She often mocks Aryan and taunts him, offering him scant sensitivity and compassion. When Sarah falls for Dr Khan and goes out to meet him, she waves a bottle of wine in her husband's face to make it clearly obvious about what her plans with Dr Khan are. When they initially meet, Khan does some kind of dodgy-looking hypnosis experiment on her to demonstrate how, to him, psychiatry and the paranormal can work in unison.  The sound mixing is amateurish. For example, you'll often hear the sound almost echoing during indoor scenes. There is an inexplicable tendency for unnecessary zoom-ins. Faces fill the frame to such an extent that the top of the character's head doesn't fit in the frame. The camera work is exceedingly amateurish. There is almost no sense of sense of flow in the way the actors deliver their lines. The quality of acting depicted is downright laughable.  During one scene before Sarah and Dr Khan get intimate, they are drinking vodka and wine, separately. She asks him something to the effect of what would happen if vodka and wine meet. This is supposed to sound seductive. Being a movie that is almost excruciating to sit through, ME fails to engage at any level. Do not waste your time and money on this ripe tub of tripe - it can be safely avoided.

Sadly, the writing and execution is so poor, dated and pointless that you wonder why anyone would make a film like this. To begin with, there is no humour in this supposed comedy. The lead actress tries her best to seem crass and thus sounds like a bhajiwali, kaamwali and a prostitute all rolled into one. Her imitation of a sex worker is anything but realistic.  movie  Also, even when we know that the protagonist is a prostitute, we are constantly told that she charges Rs 200 per night. This is in poor taste and does not amuse you.  From absurd to annoying...the story's climax has scientists discovering a remote that can make a dead person dance and grab other people's crotch.

A 'sacrificing attitude' was prime requisite once upon a time in all kinds of social/romantic dramas but that's the thing of the past. This film revolves around it and turns out to be inconsequential in return. Despite decent production values, Ishqedarriyaan fails to click as it is way too cliched. Conventional is fine as long as it leaves some impact on you as an audience, which doesn't happen here.  Evelyn Sharma for a change is not seen in skimpy outfits but her acting stays consistently poor, Mahaakshay is convincing but the film is way too tedious for you to sit through it.

In spite of being terribly formulaic and predictable, the film turns out to be a pleasant watch because of its promising lead pair. Newcomers Rishi Verma and Priyanka Mehta fit their roles perfectly and have a bright future ahead. It is their chemistry and earnest performances that lend novelty to an out-an-out conventional plot.  movie  Coming back to the story, the couple's relationship suffers after Sheen witnesses a few goons killing a man at a restaurant.

While the lead actors are decent, the supporting actors ham away to glory - villains in particular. Also, the climax seems a tad too simplistic and abrupt compared to the steady build-up.

In fact, for the longest time, you wonder what the point of this film is. While the husband wife arguments are still relatable, the protagonist suddenly discovering his gambling skills and striking up an unlikely friendship with a prostitute called Rubina (Raima Sen) seem inconsequential to the story. Rubina gets his book published without his knowledge and he in return has an issue with it being altered. While all this happens, you wonder where this is heading.  movie  When you have a talented bunch of actors like Pathak and Saurabh Shukla (as Pathak's brother-in-law here), you expect the film to have some meaning. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here. Amidst all the chaos and disagreements, you keep looking for a reason behind the story but fail to find one.

After spotting a hen in no man's land, across the LOC between India and Pakistan, a junior cook of the Indian army is forced to enter the forbidden land to claim the Murgi. As soon as the youngster is pushed into the area, Pakistani soldiers open fire objecting this move. The Indians demand that they should be allowed to retaliate.  movie  News channels lap this up leading to a war like situation. Owing to media pressure, the government assigns a committee to look into the matter. The committee comprises chairman (Annu Kapoor) and other members of the parliament, ex-servicemen and NGO workers (Om Puri, Satish Kaushik, Seema Biswas, Adil Hussain). However, these egotistical patriots are too busy fighting for their own needs and demands. What happens to the man stranded in no man's land?  Going by the content of most 24/7 news channels today, it's not hard to believe that anything and everything is made to look like 'news'. To mock that and its effect on politicians — who are otherwise cut out from the real world and real issues — is a topic worth addressing. On these grounds, Jai Ho Democracy could be lauded for its promising premise.  Sadly, a good idea is not enough. Barring the political mudslinging, which is quite believable and a few wisecracks, the film lacks good writing. Jokes are stretched and repeated to the point that they cease to be funny. Characters digressing from the core issue are doing so on purpose and that can be enjoyed only for a certain time. Overdose of this kills the humour.  With a talented cast at its disposal (Annu Kapoor in particular is outstanding) and even a decent plot, it's a shame that the film fails to capitalise on either. The script loses steam eventually, making the director resort to bizarre slapstick comedy and a farfetched climax.

The story seems disconnected and keeps meandering, failing to hold your attention. Also, you want to see the dance but there is barely any.  movie  Barring Rajesh Shringarpure, looks convincing and has worked well on his physique and body language to play his character, others sleepwalk through their roles. Girish Karnad and Roopa Ganguly try to bring some sanctity to the story but their characters hold no significance.

A flashback follows that takes us through this gang's ill-fated car journey from Mumbai to Mathura.  movie  While you expect the mystery to unfold in Nidhivan, the director tries to build up the suspense right from the beginning. So you have the usual scares...lights going on and off, car breaking down in the middle of nowhere forcing the friends to stay in a creepy lodge at night, supernatural occurrences etc. After much unnecessary drama created with the help of bad camera angles, blank screen and out-of-focus shaky photography parading as found-footage, implying the presence of ghosts for almost two hours, the characters finally reach Nidhivan. This is when you finally expect the drab film to gain some momentum and give you some real chills.  Unfortunately, the climax is so unbelievably silly, unintentionally funny and bizarre that you want to send the makers packing to Nidhivan forever.  Besides, it's not just the direction or story that's poor. The actors ham their way to glory. The writers have written like four lines for the entire film.

While his elder sister Bibi Nanaki (Puneet Sikka) and local landlord Rai Bular (Adil Hussain) recognised Nanak's divine qualities the moment he was born, his accountant father took longer to acknowledge his godly ways. Owing to his teachings that propagated equality and selflessness, Nanak was called 'guru' by his followers (Sikhs).  movie  Very rarely do you come across Indian biopics that are made on an epic scale, with its heart in its right place. Nanak Shah Fakir is one of them. Even if you are remotely fascinated by Sikhism, you must watch this one for its substantial content, spellbinding locations, impressive production values, stunning cinematography, good performances, outstanding storytelling and a mesmerising background score.  Painstakingly made, the film has this unique ability to connect with the believers as well as the non-believers, and there lies its beauty. Interestingly, despite its subject, thanks to a balanced narrative, Nanak Shah Fakir doesn't sound preachy or come across as a propaganda film. It manages to inspire, arouse compassion and strike a spiritual chord. Arif Zakaria deserves a special mention for his brilliant portrayal of Mardana, the first follower and longtime companion of Guru Nanak. He is also the narrator here.  However, while the film emerges as a clear winner in most departments, the length and shoddy makeup cannot be excused.

There are no pretentious attempts at creating drama. However, the transition of the film from being an emotional family drama to a profound road movie is wobbly and this is where it loses the grip to a certain extent.

Besides, you crave to see more of those precious little moments in the mundane life of the lonely grandmother. Her bond with the typist, who helps to send the letters across to her family, is equally touching, but the maker chooses to focus on the distress and hardships faced by random characters instead.

Also, while religion is an integral part of the story, it's the sense of loss and regret that lies at the heart of it.  Zaigham Imam' s story is much stronger than his amateur execution. Nonetheless, it deserves to be seen for its sheer thought, which is brilliant. Love transcends religion.  "},{"Name":"Black Home","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"1.5/5","Cast":"Chitrashi Rawat, Ashutosh Rana, Simran Sehmi, Sharad Ponkshe, Murli Sharma, Achint Kaur","Director":"Ashish Deo","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Director Ashish Deoa s social drama is quite disturbing as it brings to light, gory details of the extreme torture young girls are forced to put up with at Rajawadi remand home, which is actually meant to reform them. The girls get beaten up, raped, sold, forced into flesh trade, starved to death, sexually assaulted by paedophile politicians and callous staff members of the detention home, among other offences. A news channela s bureau chief DK (Ashutosh Rana) wants to expose these illegal activities and assigns newbie reporter Anjali (Simran Sehmi) to cover the case. Can there be a better future for these juvenile delinquents, whose plight goes unnoticed by the society at large?  movie  If it's solely about spreading awareness, Black Home could be lauded for raising the issue that gets brushed under the carpet mostly. However, as a film, it fails to deliver on various grounds, mainly because of poor writing and shoddy execution. It keeps harping on sexual violence without going beyond it to look into its charactersa psychological upheaval. Even their tragic backstories fail to evoke emotion. You dona t feel for the characters, despite the atrocities inflicted on them. Also ita s way too stereotypical. The warden is ill-tempered, male staff members are sleazy, politicians are rapists, TV reporters are projected as dumb, who sleep around to move up the social ladder, and so forth. Chitrashi Rawat in the central role does a decent job, but the film lets her down. Popular Marathi actor Sharad Ponkshe is wasted and deserves better.  Speaking of execution, the story refuses to proceed. After a while, you want to tell the makers a Yes, we get it. The girls are not safe in the remand homes, but whata s the solutiona ? Jabbar Patela s Marathi film Umbartha, starring Smita Patil, though told from a different perspective, touched upon this issue in a way that it was genuine.

Sepia tones and a melancholy mood effectively capture the anguish of uprooted Sikh families crossing the border and arriving in India. Like the rest of his tribe, Umber Singh (Irrfan) leaves the ghosts of his past behind and starts to rebuild his life and home. While Umber is struggling to find a sense of belonging in the new land, his wife Mehar (Tisca Chopra), who has three daughters, is worried she will deliver a fourth girl. But Umber, who longs for a son, has already made up his mind to raise his fourth child as a boy - irrespective of its sex.  movie  Surely enough, when his fourth child turns out to be a daughter, Umber raises her as a boy - in a move that is part delusional, part self-resentment and part despair. Not only is Kanwar (Tillotama Shome) made to dress like a boy and adopt manly routines, she is also married off by his father to a naive gypsy girl, Neeli (Rasika Dugal). When the truth unfolds on the wedding night, a cheated Neeli is placated by Umber who offers her his wealth just to keep his family secret intact.  Anup Singh's film, told in a languid fashion (a bit too slow at times), narrates a story which immediately strikes a chord with Indian society that is obsessed with producing sons. It also boldly shows that the Partition may have affected people in a subliminal way, but its wounds run deep. Qissa has a disturbing effect and in that, lies the film's strength. It is also shot beautifully across deserts, snow-capped mountains and lush, green landscape.  Irrfan, Tisca and Tillotama give A-grade performances, making this film imminently watchable. If only the filmmaker had decided to buck the pace up for a bit, the points being made here would have hit home harder.

It has drawn inspiration from various films, the most prominent being Jennifer Aniston-starrer Picture Perfect (1997).  movie  In this case, what could have been an interesting take on relationships in a social media-driven, opinionated world, gets marred by juvenile dialogues and silly issues. To begin with, the lead actress is shown facing 'peer pressure' - something you are most likely to face in your 20s and not 30s.  Her friends too sound immature for their age. For instance, one of the guys in the group who's not ready to settle down reacts, \"It's my bad karma\", when his girlfriend tells him that she is expecting a baby. One of the other friends, who's busy making money, tells his wife, \"Enough is enough, you better get back to being my wife\", when she raises concern about their marriage falling apart. Then enters Aliya's contractual beau Hridhaan aka Suki (Sobti), who manages to sweep her friends off their feet. Only if he was Mr. Right!  Television actor Barun Sobti makes his Bollywood debut here and is probably the only saving grace of this film. Perfectly cast as a diehard Salman Khan fan, Barun amuses you with his desi humour and does complete justice to the role. Shenaz Treasuryvala fits the role too, but her character is poorly written.  Our hunt for the 'perfect' Bollywood rom-com continues...

Our main character Aslam (Hussain) is the village Simple Simon who by his own admission is a 'puncture-wala' and runs a small, home-grown business. He also has a problem with his neighbour, who he is shown to have a major row with early on in the film. The altercation turns violent however and the two are separated. What is not known to his dutiful and beautiful wife Hameeda (Mona Singh) is that he is having an affair with Saeeda (Ekavali Khanna), who he sneaks out to visit under cover of the night for some sexual healing rather than just polite conversation.  movie  Aslam's luck changes when he, as an important person at a nearby holy place, happens to be around when the Prime Minister of India happens to visit the holy place for blessings. The PM is shown not to speak English and he appears to need his assistant to do translation duties for him. Aslam tells him that he will be blessed if he gives up various vices of the flesh and appetite. The PM replies that he will only give up ladies' fingers, as in, the vegetable. Nonetheless, the PM is grateful to Aslam and provides him with special security after Aslam tells him that he is troubled by certain neighbourhood elements. In time, Aslam gets used to his status and the power goes to his head. He is then persuaded into chasing political ambitions. How he copes with it comprises the rest of the film. The narrative, while apparently authentic is overly long, unfocused and takes too long to get to the point to depict its satirical content. The subject matter could have been interesting but it is mired in tedious, very boring, rural and regional cliches that audiences have already seen, so many times.

Their respective stories are played out in a series of lengthy flashbacks. Titoo's mom urges him to get a career and get married while his dad is supportive of whatever he does, as long as it is honest. So Titoo opens a liquor store, but the women of the mohalla complain about that. Next, he tries working in a lingerie store, but is slapped and sacked when he accidentally tries to cop a feel with one of the ladies while measuring her bra size. Similarly, other jobs come and go. Meanwhile, our heroine Gulshan is a hockey-loving tomboy who would rather display her skills with a hockey stick on the field rather than with a belan, rolling out warm rotis in a kitchen. But this tomboy is eventually tamed when she meets Titoo, whom she completely falls for.  movie  But hang on, the MBA in the movie stands for 'Married But Available' ratherthan the degree and unbeknownst to her, Titoo makes his moolah privately,'entertaining' lonely ladies at night. She hits the roof (and him as well) when she finds out about this. Does Titoo ultimately manage to mend his marriage?  What really keeps this movie trundling along are the surprisingly refreshing performances from the lead pair. Jaiswal in particular has screen presence and her act is promising at best. The earthy Punjabi humour also works (incidentally, just about every Punjabi cliche is flogged here, from suffixing almost everything with 'ji' to multiple mentions of aloo parathas), but the sexual innuendoes do not. And apart from that, there's not really much else going for this one.

The Blair Witch Project (1999) put the genre on the map, making 'based on real life events' the perfect promotional gimmick. Paranormal Activity's (2007) success further popularised the genre. Unfortunately, in spite of being inspired by the technique years after it became famous, we still fail to nail it.  movie  For starters, for a film to instill fear in your mind, haunting silence is of extreme importance. Fear of the unknown only grips you when you are quiet enough to feel its existence. Sadly, our brand of talkative, conversation-heavy horror films, continue to drive us up the wall as is the case here.  The friends can't shut up to save their lives. When not suffering from verbal diarrhoea, they find time to get scared by strategically-placed voodoo dolls and human skulls.  Also, instead of shocking us, assuming we (the audience) are naive, we are told exactly when the ghosts are about to enter the frame of Sid's (one of the boys) handheld camera with a seemingly infinite battery life. Upon the ghost's arrival, the footage becomes black and white, and we are made to hear mysterious footsteps. As the gang keeps going in circles, since they are lost in the woods, you are more annoyed than petrified since you are prepared for it.  No matter how cliched, films based on this premise manage to keep you engaged, based on your curiosity to find out who survives. But when even that's given out right in the beginning, will you still be thrilled about the climax? Of the many flaws, this is the worst drawback. The demonic possession looks funny too.  While the sound is probably the only decent aspect of this film, the rest grossly disappoints.

Preeti takes the initiative of introducing Ashok to eligible girls. While he does seem interested in one of them (Diksha Basu), call it a coincidence or fate, he bumps into an American girl (Lethia Nall), who makes him question the compromise he's about to make. Will he settle down for a better future or be content with the present?  movie  A Decent Arrangement has an interesting premise. A slice-of-life tale, it addresses the issue of identity crisis that plagues most American-born-confused-desis. Ashok represents those who don't know what they want.  Also, unlike most films that exaggerate and mock the arranged marriage culture, Sarovar Banka manages to keep it real and balanced. He takes an objective look at the age-old system and its relevance to individuals today. Subtle humour is infused smartly into the story, ensuring the film stays light-hearted. We particularly liked the Shabana-Adam banter on 'how a boy should respond to job enquiries made by his potential in-laws'.  However, the film gets too philosophical and sluggish for your liking eventually. Just because it's set in India, why should you play a sitar in the background at any given opportunity? Also, random shots of horse carriages and cycle rickshaws running on the streets of Chandigarh get unnecessary footage. Foreigners discussing how they fear contracting malaria and suffering from a case of Delhi belly is sleep-inducing. This cliched treatment makes the film look like an amateurish India-travel video, shot by a tourist.  Though cast in a supporting role, it is Shabana Azmi, who holds the film together with her sheer presence. Adam Laupus is sincere but way too monotonous.  A Decent Arrangement draws inspiration from Nagesh Kukunoor's much acclaimed Hyderabad Blues but ends up being nothing more than a decent attempt at showing what has already been shown before.

It salutes the valour of the Sikh warriors, their noble principles and immense contribution towards the establishment of the religion.  movie  Kudos to Harry Baweja for telling the iconic tale of how Guru Gobind Singh (who initiated the Sikh Khalsa), his brave sons and fearless warriors refused to bow down to the Mughals, led by Wazir Khan in the battle of Chamkaur, in spite of being outnumbered by them.  Legendary actor Om Puri's baritone voice drives the narrative and gives us a background of what led the Guru to leave Anandpur sahib in the first place. The film then shows us how the Chaar Sahibzaade (Ajit Singh, Jujhar Singh, Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh) sacrificed their lives to safeguard their people and religion. It also shows show how the Mughals, having failed to capture Guru Gobind Singh, ruthlessly bricked his younger sons alive for not converting to Islam.  As an animation film, what it lacks is technology (given today's 3D animation standards), Chaar Sahibzaade makes up for it with its strong and engaging content. Also one needs to consider that the makers had limitations, since one cannot animate Guru Gobind Singh. Thus, all the images of the Guru are only stills. Even the voice-over artists are not named, considering the sensitivity of the subject.  Harry Baweja manages to inspire and touch your heart by bringing the historic event to life with great conviction. If your kids fancy the fictional American superheroes, show them this film for sure. They must know our 'heroes' lived for real, fought for real and had no superpowers except for unflinching courage and devotion.

Their lives fall apart once again as heartache and guilt take centre-stage. Painful memories come flooding back, leading them to the place where it all began.  movie  You can never run away from your problems. You have to face them at some point and forgive yourself if you seek peace of mind. This message pretty much lies at the heart of this film. If you record your thoughts and install a camera to capture your moods, the result would turn out to be somewhat like Fireflies.  If unhurried, self-indulgent, elegantly executed artistic cinema appeals to you, you'll like this one. The songs are cathartic and lend meaning to the situations. Cinematography is a highlight too - the camera beautifully lingers on faces as feelings find a voice. All the actors do a fine job but it is Arjun Mathur who stands out with his understated act.  However, in spite of the visual beauty of it all, what doesn't go in the film's favour is the story that drifts away and refuses to get back on track. Once you get past the loss and longing that haunts the characters, there is nothing new that adds to the story or takes it forward. The stagnancy gets repetitive and ineffective beyond a point.  Overall, the 'darkness' stays on for way too long, thanks to the troubled characters and their complicated relationships. If you are attracted to such melancholia, go for this one.

Bharti Bhatia (Rekha)'s NRI grandson, Mann (Sharman Joshi) who gets his tenses mixed up when he speaks Hindi (unfortunately, that is meant to evoke laughter), arrives in India, without any bags, to see his grandma!  movie  At home, he sees her being relegated to the kitchen by her family of bullies that includes her boorish husband, R K Bhatia (Randhir Kapoor in flashy maroon jackets), her son, her daughter-in-law (who aspires to be an actress) and a terribly irritating daughter — all of who take turns to remind Rekha that she shouldn't even attempt crossing the threshold of their home.  Obviously, director Indra Kumar (who has previously given us hits like Dil, Beta, Raja, Ishq, Grand Masti) is stuck in a time warp. As are his lead characters, his writers and everyone else who is associated with this hackneyed movie.  So for the first half, you have the 'bechari nani' sporting grey strands in her hair and dark under-eye make-up constantly talking to her 'Kanha'(God). As expected, in the second half, the grandson pays for her trip to the beauty salon and voila, what do you have? Rekha, the mannequin!  Super Nani becomes super model (nothing less, mind it), selling everything from dishwashers to detergents. To showcase her acting skills, Nani also does take-offs on cinema greats like Nargis, Waheeda Rehman and Madhubala. And, just when you are falling off your seat laughing, wondering what's next in store, you are told Nani has won the woman of substance award for inculcating values in her errant children and wayward husband. Really?  Somewhere along the 133 minutes, you're bound to wonder - why did drop-dead gorgeous Rekha agree to do this film? One can say that India's self-styled Greta Garbo is a frog in the well. She obviously hasn't seen English Vinglish and Queen during her Parliament break.

Obviously, the 'hunters' soon realise that their plan may not be foolproof after all and their lives could be in danger. From running out of useful resources in the dense mangrove forest, being chased by the vicious local poacher Bheera (Subrat Dutta) to facing the dangerous tigers, the group is forced to take the ultimate test of survival.  movie  Those who are not hooked onto Hollywood films won't mind watching (former actor) Kamal Sadanah's ambitious directorial debut, which can be applauded for its novelty and decent VFX. Kamal has dared to make an animal-centric thriller, a genre unexplored in Bollywood.  The sound effects, background score, visual effects, cinematography - especially the aerial shots of the Sundarbans - manage to create a tense mood. Even the end credits have been shot well. However, the excessively weak story acts as a major spoiler. No sane person would risk his life and go looking for a tigress in a tiger reserve to seek revenge! It's unethical, illogical, immoral, all rolled into one. Even as a survival thriller, it fails to hold your attention. For how long can visuals make up for a drab story?  The performances disappoint as well. Abhinav Shukla is decent but has no scope and the rest are forgettable. Nora Fatehi's skimpy clothes are simply inappropriate given the setting and Himarsha V's weird dialogue delivery adds to your burden. The constant commentary about the history and culture of the jungles gets boring too.  You can still watch the film if you are obsessed with the Sundarbans or the tigers (in that order).

On reaching his uncle's house in India, he gets caught in an ongoing income tax raid. But that's not his issue. He is more concerned about whom he should get married to...a Bengali income tax officer who lisps, a typical Gujarati Dandiya teacher or the wealthiest of them all, Maya? To add to his confusion, his lookalike pretends to be him for obvious reasons.  movie  If you thought Humshakals was unbearable, at least you had a good-looking actor like Saif Ali Khan in it. Imagine the plight of witnessing two obscure actors playing the double role in a story that's as dated as the Ramsay brothers' horror. Given the actors, Daler Mehndi's title track, location and setting, Kabab Mein Haddi would have probably clicked as a Punjabi film. As a Hindi language film, it's simply sleep inducing.  Former cricketer Dinesh Mongia mimics Amitabh Bachchan as he plays his diehard fan in the film. Barring this, nothing manages to even remotely amuse you. Also, scenes involving the 'tribute to Bachchan mithai shop', where sweets are named after the superstar's super-hit films are also funny. Sadly, remembering Bachchan doesn't salvage the otherwise immature script. The topic of sexual orientation and homosexuality pops out of nowhere and ends up looking like a joke, though the intention is noble.  This one is not even unintentionally funny, so go eat kababs and watch something else...anything else!

The storytelling fails to evoke a sense of urgency that the character should ideally portray. Everything seems hunky-dory, with unnecessary songs plugged in, until characters get randomly killed.  The film fails to strike a chord as Sonali battles it out with the chairman (Kher) of a rival cable company. You don't feel the shrewdness of the villain or bravery of the lead character and therein lies the film's core problem. The forced humour doesn't salvage the situation either.  Rhea Chakraborty tries hard but doesn't fit the role of a typical Maharashtrian girl as she doesn't look or even remotely sound like one. In spite of getting an author-backed role, she fails to capture the nuances of her character. She ends her loud sentences with cuss words as if she was reminded to do so.  Ali Fazal is Rhea's love interest. He plays second fiddle to an actress once again and is likeable in his character. Smita Jaykar and Anupam Kher (comic villain) are impressive and probably the only actors who lend some significance to the film. Ace lyricist Swanand Kirkire is surprisingly good in his brief role. Dancer Raghav Juyal is decent too.  The film has a good concept but lacks the vibrancy and spirit of the city it is set in. Overall, it faces 'connectivity' issues.

Even though it's formulaic, a haunting background score, effective usage of 3D, especially in the scenes featuring mirrors, decent performances and predominantly a 'fear of the unknown' manage to keep you on the edge of your seat. Gripping and atmospheric, just when you think this horror film might actually be able to scare the living daylights out of you, enters 'lady in white' Veena Malik and her predictable back-story. movie  As a ghost, her makeup and look are effective, but what doesn't work is her penchant for flying in the sky like a superman. Also, the scenes, where clad in lingerie, she makes scandalous statements and then pouts in a bikini take away from the build-up and the creepy mood created in the first half. Her 'sex appeal' is made the point of focus as the film progresses and that is absolutely unnecessary.  Karanvir Bohra, Vedita Pratap Singh and Vije Bhatia act well. Unfortunately, Veena Malik is made out to be the show-stealer and she does grab your attention, mostly for the wrong reasons.  Overall, this film is somewhat like a Bollywoodised version of the Final Destination series. As horror, it partially works but as a slasher, gets too monotonous and repetitive...old wine in an old bottle.  "},{"Name":"Jigariyaa","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Harshvardhan Deo, Cherry Mardia, Navni Parihar, Virendra Saxena","Director":"Raj Purohit","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours 21 minutes","Review":" Set in Agra in the late 80's, Jigariyaa revives the magic of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. It traces the lives of two young lovers Shyamlal Gupta (Harshvardhan Deo) and Radhika (Cherry Mardia), who dream of an idealistic future.  movie  However, villains in their fairytale romance happen to be their parents, who are more concerned about their standing in the society. The two are forced to give up on their relationship as maan and maryada are of prime importance. Will they break the norms of society and get back together or succumb to it?  In spite of its run of the mill story, Jigariyaa is quite a commendable attempt. The newcomers are the film's USP and they give their best. They deliver solid performances and have the ability to make it big in Bollywood. Harshvardhan Deo as an aspiring poet (shayar) is charming, while the beautiful Cherry Mardia makes an impression. Their depiction of the protagonists' 'innocent love' sets the film apart.  The cinematography is stunning too. Colours, heritage sites and historical locations are used beautifully. That reminds one of Raanjhanaa. The music is soulful and the script allows you to feel for the central characters.  However, the film could have been at least 30 minutes shorter. The story stays static for a long time in the first half. You get impatient for the climax and while it's effective, it does seem a tad pointless. A cliched story and sluggish pace are major drawbacks. If it wasn't for that, Jigariyaa could have been a film worth remembering.  Nonetheless, the film can be watched for its purity and simplicity. It ably captures the beauty of small towns and first love...love before technology happened. Love before sexual desire found its place in films.  "},{"Name":"Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Anupam Kher, Aditi Sharma, Divyendu Sharma, Manu Rishi Chadha, Neha Dhupia","Director":"Ravindra Gautam","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 20 minutes","Review":" Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami is a fitting tribute to the common man who still values his self-respect more than his pay cheque. Nearing his retirement, living in a modest chawl in Mumbai, Purushottam Narayan Joshi (Anupam Kher) serves the BMC diligently as a jamadar for 37 years of his life. While he takes pride in his morals, discipline and work ethics, annoyed by his unyielding honesty, his sons Shekhar (Manu Rishi Chadha) and Subhash (Divyendu Sharma) think otherwise. They find his 'lectures' boring and low-paying job worthless.  movie  However, a heartbreaking incident forces them to analyse their mindset. On his death-bed, their father demands a 21-cannon salute as an acknowledgement of his flawless character, a certificate of 'respect' he never received. On the other hand, a corrupt politician, his publicity-seeking mistress and opportunistic mother have their own agendas. Is honesty indeed a curse in today's world?  Poignant and riveting, Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami deserves a salute for its unique concept. Films with a social message could get preachy, but thanks to unconventional execution, the director skillfully overcomes that. Having displayed his acting prowess a billion times before, Anupam Kher once again proves that he is the master of his craft. He moves you to tears with his heart-rending performance. He is also the reason you are able to relate to the story.  The supporting cast is equally competent. Aditi Sharma, Uttara Baokar and Neha Dhupia in particular make their mark. Music lends depth to the proceedings. However, while the film clicks as a social satire, certain comic situations in the second half seem far-fetched. The pace drops as well but picks up eventually.  In times where materialistic things have taken precedence over people and good old values, ETKS is one of the most socially relevant films to have come out this year. It's not just a film but a philosophy.  "},{"Name":"Tamanchey","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Nikhil Dwivedi, Richa Chadha, Damandeep Singh Siddhu","Director":"Navneet Behal","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"1 hour 53 minutes","Review":" In Tamanchey, instead of a self-righteous boy serenading a vestal virgin, you have a bad boy romancing a bad girl. No explanations are offered on why Munna (Nikhil Dwivedi), a petty thief, is infatuated with drug peddler Babu (Richa Chadha) or why either of them is so drawn to a life of crime. But does this alone qualify as a coming-of-age pulp fiction romantic thriller? By the end of the film, your answer is that only the intention should be applauded, not necessarily the execution.  movie  A police vehicle carrying Babu and Munna to prison, falls into a ravine, leaving only three survivors -- one cop and two criminals. While the cop is too shaken to notice, the baddies thank their lucky stars and escape. The two are inexplicably drawn to one another, considering he is shown as crass and she, hard-as-nails, attempting to be a stylish diva. What follows is their love-making on a truck, carrying tomatoes somewhere in the heartland of north India - and yes, that seals it for a love-struck Munna.  For a while, the lovers are oblivious but three becomes a crowd with the entry of a tainted-for-doping, medal-winning wrestler Rana (Damandeep Singh Siddhu) who is now a mafia kingpin. He and Babu, who turns out to be his mistress, peddle drugs on the India-Nepal border with the help of avaricious cops. And the drama becomes interesting when Munna who continues to be besotted by Babu - despite now knowing she is the don's girl - joins the same gang.  The Babu-Munna romantic escapades in bank vaults and dimly lit terraces do have their own appeal. But their modus operandi gets stale because of its repetitive nature. All through, the 1983 RD Burman ditty Pyar mein dil pe maar de goli appears in a reprised version, thus making brave attempts to pep up the proceedings, as does the title track.  One star in the rating is reserved solely for the livewire, Richa Chadha. Like in Fukrey, in Tamanchey too, she gets her bindaas, badass girl act pat.

The baby grows up to become the dashing Arjun (Rajniesh Duggal), who does odd jobs in Germany. How he lands up there is told in a long flashback. Apparently, his foster father papaji (Ranjeet) emotionally blackmails him to do so.  movie  Cut to Germany, Arjun falls in love with Anupama (Subhashree Ganguly) whom he knows since his college days in UP, India. Another flashback and a few songs later (all dream sequences with firang backup dancers), he returns to India to take care of papaji, who gets attacked by goons. These bad guys happen to be power-hungry politicians connected to Arjun's past. Would Germany-returned Arjun be able to put together the jigsaw puzzle?  Spark has too many things going against it like sluggish pace, convoluted story, insignificant characters, inane songs, inconsequential plot twists and over-the-top gravity-defying (superhero-esque) baffling stunts. While the villains ham away to glory (barring the talented Ashutosh Rana), our righteous hero stays inexpressive. Given his urban looks and mannerisms, he doesn't look like he hails from UP.  Also, the film faces an identity crisis itself. It begins as a crime thriller, shifts to romance, returns to politics and gundagardi in UP and ends up as a 'boy avenging the death of his family' drama. Too many things rolled into one. The only thing that works is the father-son bond displayed.  Overall, not many will have the patience to sit through this dreary tale. The title is misleading for sure.

This desi adaptation of the 2010 Tom Cruise-Cameron Diaz action thriller, Knight And Day, has charm in abundance, primarily because of its effervescent lead pair -- Rajveer/Jai ( Hrithik Roshan) and Harleen (Katrina Kaif). But it lacks coherence. Disbelief is writ large on the face, right at the start.  movie  Picture this - India's most wanted, Omar Zafar (Danny Denzongpa), who is to be extradited to India, escapes from a maximum-security prison in Britain because his aide Hamid Gul (Jaaved Jafferi) blows up the place like it is a cardboard edifice. They also kill the honest ISS agent, Viren Nanda (Jimmy Sheirgill) in the process. Next, Zafar suggests that he can actually hold up the UK-India extradition treaty by getting an Indian to rob the Kohinoor. Really?  Aimed at providing more style than substance, the film makes you comfortably numb in the first 20 minutes itself. So you may perhaps just raise an eyebrow as you watch Katrina, a bank receptionist from Shimla (with a liberal grandmother who tells her to go chase love), on a global escapade -- London, Prague, Greece... in the company of a \"psychopathic schizophrenic\" jewel thief, Hrithik, after meeting him on one blind date.  If you're still looking to make sense, Hrithik has a back-story on why he attempted to steal the Kohinoor. Or why he chose guns over roses. Kaif, convinced of his good intentions, is happy to cling to him with gay abandon.  Anand's film has no grammar. But it compensates with breathtaking locales and stylishly choreographed stunts. It also works as a show reel for the bronzed Roshan with his six-pack abs and the enviable midriff of Kaif wearing a red polka-dotted bikini top. Their horseplay caters to an audience that is low on IQ and high on adrenalin!  Full marks to the lead pair for not being overwhelmed by the commotion around them. Especially Hrithik, who knows the job at hand is silly, but never slips up.

Can Sunny (Rannvijay Singh) and his friends (Salil Acharya, Kavin Dave) manage to decode the mystery surrounding the mills during this ungodly hour?  movie  3 A.M borrows from Paranormal Activity and Mirrors to a certain extent. That's not an issue since most horror films lack originality. However, this film fails to match up to the scares and chills provided by its Hollywood predecessors, that make you go numb with fear. And lack of deadly silence is a major reason behind the failure of the premise, which otherwise had potential.  A good horror film is atmospheric and this one falls flat here. You want the actors to 'stop talking' for a while but that doesn't happen till the end. They constantly engage in silly banter, chatting or debating trivial issues, giving you headaches instead of fear.  No time or effort is invested to create the desired mood. Also, dialogues to the effect of, 'Hum rudra ki aatma ko provoke karte hai' do not work. Besides, a bizarre flashback at the most inappropriate moment ruins it.  About the cast, Rannvijay Singh looks good and his presence is the best part about the film. However, we wish he does something non-Roadies the next time on the big screen. Salil Acharya and Kavin Dave are decent in supporting roles.  3 A.M is a conversation-heavy horror film. If that doesn't put you off, you can give it a shot.

It comes as no surprise that our protagonists, Balwinder from Patiala (Shaan) and Balwinder from Ludhiana (Mika) for obvious reasons, rise to the occasion and claim to be the missing grandson. But who's telling the truth?  Speaking of the story, Balwinder Singh Famous Ho Gaya seems like a mishmash of multiple films. It draws inspiration from Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (although Mika and Shaan are no Salman and Akshay), Andaz Apna Apna and Rohit Shetty's Golmaal. While the first half decently entertains, things go haywire as the story progresses. Barring a scene or two, the writing is neither clever nor funny enough to make you laugh. The length of the film is another issue.  Acclaimed singers Mika and Shaan make their acting debut in this supposed comedy. While both are comfortable on camera and can act, Mika steals the show. Shaan is easy on the eye but his overacting gets on your nerves eventually. Mika, on the contrary, is pleasantly understated. He also walks away with better songs.  Brazilian actress Gabriela Bertante cannot act or dance to save her life. Her presence is limited to being a glamorous prop in the songs who flaunts her assets at the drop of a hat. Anupam Kher proves what a fine actor he is, in spite of making a late entry in the film.  While things stay mediocre throughout, the final nail in the coffin is seeing Rajpal Yadav and Vindu Dara Singh dressed as girls. That sight is simply repulsive.

You do not feel for the characters or the protagonist's brave battle against the system. The mood and setting created fail to match up to the maturity displayed by the actors.

The film also seems plagued by sound recording issues. For instance, if a scene shows a jeep passing over potholes on a watery lane, the 'pothole hitting' sound comes first and the jeep comes later.

Rani Nirmala (Ratna) and Yuvraj Vikram (Fawad) expect a quiet medic who will blend blandly into royal discipline - but they get a live-wire who teases the dishy Yuvraj, 'Raja log praja ke saath party nahin karte?', whose therapy includes drinking wine with her charge, who crushes paapads noisily onto regal china, and who, in striped PJs and cartoon-coloured T-shirts, is no fashionista.  movie  Sonam carries off her finest role yet with zany flair, as smoothly goofy as her patchwork jacket. She's matched ably by hipster heart-throb Fawad Khan, who brings Vikram - of corduroy-dry manners and melting-chocolate voice - alive.  The pair sizzles but the best giggles go to Kirron Kher, playing Mili's mummy Manju, with some of this laugh riot's funniest lines, including berating the 'royal kanjar khana!'. Kirron runs away with her vibrant role, finely balanced against Ratna Pathak's grim self-control and Aamir Raza Husain's wine-soaked self-pity - that finally shows some spark.  But there's more khoobsurti here. Romance between the lead pair is like perfume sprayed onto air while the evolution of Mili, from wild-child to dignified woman, and Vikram, from stick-in-royal-sand to a confused, vulnerable man, show.  Meanwhile, characters roam palaces on Wodehouse-like trails, seeking chocolate - and beds - during dark nights, mothers face-off in a clash of curlers, Mili's clumsiness resounds like clattering cutlery while desperately smitten Vikram reminds himself, 'Uski aankhen hain, taangein mat dekh!' Oh, and that he has a fiance (Aditi Rao Hydari) already.  Paying the first Khoobsurat a whimsical wave - poet-cook Ashrafi basically strokes his gamcha here - this movie reflects modern times. Mili's had pre-Vikram boyfriends, no-one needs heart attacks for enlightenment - and just when you think the turbanned titles are a royal pain, Manju arrives, spitting fire at regal airs.  An underdone kidnapping and overdone Bengali-ness - 'Prawteek', meet 'Mawnju' - slightly distract. However, for the most part, this delightfully roguish romance tickles everything fun-loving inside you.  That's what makes it so khoobsurat.

To make things worse for the viewer, none of them has a sensible role. Their presence is as meaningless as the very existence of this film, which boasts of an outdated plot.  movie  Desi Veeru (Aatri Kumar) falls in love with videsi Kiran (Nilufer Salehi) and she, for some weird reason, loves him too. But Veeru's conservative parents want him to get married to their daughter-in-law's younger sister, because she is beautiful and traditional. Also, Kiran's mother wants her to marry a rich guy. What happens to their love story?  The film belongs to 90s Bollywood and not in a good way. Backup dancers doing co-ordinated dance moves on the hills, people faking British accents to pretend they are UK-returned and a melodramatic cliched story that can put you to sleep...the film struggles on various grounds. The lead actors don't have much to do except for indulging in some random banter and dancing to some irrelevant songs.  No matter how inconsequential, the film may still find an audience in those who don't mind laughing at jokes, no matter how juvenile.

So you must congratulate Bhatt for this.  movie  The plot revolves around folklore that there are Brahmarakshas—some kind of creatures who are suffering from the curse of Lord Brahma. These half-men, half-animal creatures, according to the film's story, still exist in Indian jungles because they cannot find salvation.  This film unfolds in picturesque Himachal Pradesh. And you hold your breath when you first spot a beautiful forest lodge surrounded by lush greenery. Your smile stays firmly in place when you meet the bombshell heiress of the place, Aahna (Bipasha Basu), a go-getter who endeavours to give you heaven on earth. She multitasks—from the reception to the kitchen with super charm. Naturally, the guests arrive at the idyllic location with stars in their eyes.  But alas, a Brahmarakshas is on the prowl. Stealthily it closes the distance between itself and a couple of honeymooners. With the film being done in 3-D, you find the creature's talons and tail reaching out for you in your auditorium seat. For a teeny-weeny part, that smile disappears. And as your palpitations rise, severed blood-soaked limbs pile up.  It's a worrying sight for most. However, the chief of police is an insensitive sort. He callously blames the attacks on wild animals instead of hunting down the real killer. But Aahna decides she will take charge.  The action picks up when the sexy girl and the 10-feet long creature (an amalgamation of Phantom, the ghost who walks, and Steven Spielberg's dinosaur from Jurassic Park) lock themselves in battle.  There is a romantic track between Imran Abbas Naqvi (Karan Malhotra) and Bipasha that should have smouldered. However, it falls flat because there is no chemistry between the lead pair. Bipasha is steamier when flirting with danger (read creature). Also, had this film been 15 minutes shorter, it could have been more spine-chilling.

Angie (Deepika) is the daughter-in-law of Madame Rosalyn (Dimple), two lovely widows living in the Goan village of Pokolim, a place that's gently fallen off the map. Time quietly passes Pokolim by - until its postmaster Ferdie (Naseeruddin) has his proposal to Stefanie Fernandes returned, unopened after 46 years.  movie  Angie's determined to help devastated Ferdie find answers. She enlists the rusting Impala of Ruben-like painter Don Pedro (Pankaj Kapoor), lusting after amply endowed Rosie, the group driven by Angie's snarling, stubbly ex Savio (Arjun). Do they find Fanny - and love?  Finding Fanny sails on the fresh breeze of Deepika's smooth performance, her lonely Angie happy, yet tremblingly vulnerable, her face covered with a lace-like tension when she asks Savio, \"Are you...married?\" Alongside, the movie's mast is Dimple's unabashed, terrific Rosie, whose backside drives Pedro to paroxysms of painterly lust, who throatily screams, \"Stupppid! I'll castrate these dogs one day!\"  Naseer as bumbling, fumbling Ferdie is the perfect foil to the luminous ladies - he recalls a desi Mr. Bean, showing just enough spark to sidestep being a has-been. As sardonic Don Pedro, Pankaj Kapoor has the funniest lines, delivered with sleazy flourish - \"You Casanova of the Konkan!\", he goads Ferdie, while Arjun Kapoor makes a knuckle-sucking sexy Savio, who adores Angie but can't say it - till she climbs atop him on a gorgeous, phosphorescent night.  Finding Fanny is funny, dark, yet bright, a shimmering ride through a Goa far from the tight-rooted Trikal, the touristy Dil Chahta Hai. Its drama keeps surprising - but also meanders, including around an overacting Russian and an unnecessarily macabre cat. It evokes an Almodovar-Anderson-Marquez-in-Goa feel, but occasionally, its cleverness grows obvious while little details - catch the changing colours of Ferdie's petrol can - are overlooked.  However, these are small creases on an otherwise scrumptious cake. Move your fanny for this one. For the most part, it is utterly, bitterly delicious.  "},{"Name":"Mary Kom","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"4.0/5","Cast":"Priyanka Chopra, Sunil Thapa, Darshan Kumar","Director":"Omung Kumar","Genre":"Biopic","Duration":"2 hours 3 minutes","Review":" When adapted for the big screen a biopic has to tread its own path. Debutant director Omung Kumar's Mary Kom is based on incidents in the life of Mary Kom(Priyanka Chopra), India's most high-profile female-pugilist between the years 1991-2007. And since there are few hidden facets on the boxer's life the viewer may find few surprises. The film has been shot for the better part in Imphal,(Dharamshala and Manali masquerading as Manipur), where this sportswoman was bred. Born in a humble home in Kangathei, Manipur, Mary was only a teenager when she decided to pursue boxing, despite inviting her father's ire.  movie  Literally starting with street brawls, Magnificent Mary, as she is nicknamed, blazes her path from ignominy to fame under the tutelage of her coach M. Narjit Singh (Sunil Thapa). But wait, she also chooses to make way for matters of the heart, marriage and kids before coming back to winning global recognition again in 2008, 2010 and 2012. The filmmaker has captured her indefatigable spirit beautifully. He has also thrown light on the administration's apathy towards sports and every time a film mirrors the red-tapism involved in the arena, you want to pick up the baton!  Mary Kom is Bollywood's answer to the Oscar-winner Million Dollar Baby (2004), where Hilary Swank plays an amateur boxing champ trained by Clint Eastwood. But the similarities are only because the protagonists in both films are female boxers. The intention is definitely not to ape.  One star in the rating is definitely reserved for Priyanka. She may not have transcended the physical attributes of the diminutive Mary in the actual sense (except adding a few obvious freckles to her face and slightly drooping eyelids), but she has brought the boxer to life convincingly enough, leaving you rooting for her, long after the end credits roll.  Omung has a tight check on the proceedings post-intermission. The emotional tracks between the boxer and her father (Robin Das), and Mary and her husband Onler (Darshan Kumar), leave you misty-eyed.  But the main reason why Mary Kom appeals is because it doesn't just give you a ringside view of boxing; it leaves you rooting for our sportsmen who have put India on the world map.  "},{"Name":"Raja Natwarlal","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Emraan Hashmi, Humaima Malick, Paresh Rawal, Kay Kay Menon, Deepak Tijori","Director":"Kunal Deshmukh","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"2 hours 21 minutes","Review":" Raja Natwarlal is a golden-hearted con for it leaves you smiling at its tricks, despite obvious flaws. Raja (Emraan) and partner Raghav (Deepak) pull off small confidence tricks in an appealing Mumbai of clattering trains, fragrant Iranis and gleaming dance bars. Raja loves dancer Zia (Humaima) and is set to marry after he persuades Raghav to steal 80 lakhs - which belong to big-time swindler Vardha (Kay Kay), who makes Raghav pay with his life. Raja's determined to take revenge but he needs the guru of crooks, Yogi (Paresh), to guide him. Will Yogi agree - and will Raja win?  movie  With its twisting story, good-looking frames and zingy acting, Raja Natwarlal keeps you entertained. Paresh Rawal stands out as Yogi, short-tempered, foul-mouthed and shrewd, a malicious mentor - \"Kheenche hue kaan se mila hua gyaan hamesha yaad rehta hai\" - wincing as he mentions \"a very sweet boy\", the fine actor displaying the flair of an old lion that eats bottles of rum. Kay Kay matches with his Vardha, a savage in a suit, oil-slick and lean, desperately keen on acquiring a cricket team, ready to bludgeon his way towards this. And Emraan convinces too, Raja both swaggering and vulnerable, a hero who smiles shyly, then kisses on the mouth (although pecks on the cheek can get more passionate than the demure caresses here). Pakistani actor Humaima presents a graceful Zia, her role relatively slender but including chest-thumping numbers like 'Mere hothon ke namak-pare', which will have your inner tapori tapping her feet.  The plot travels from Mumbai to Dharamshala and Cape Town but director Kunal Deshmukh retains firm control. The story packs in paisa, pyaar, confidence, over-confidence, chummas, chases, corrupt cops, cricket associations, surprises and some rather nice songs - but keeps its weight under control. Despite flaws - like how a don like Vardha doesn't know the face of a man he's seeking, who's now persuading him to buy a non-existent team - Raja Natwarlal wins you over by the sassy swagger of its tricks, its hit-men and 'HDMC Bank', its tongue lodged firmly in its cheek.  Go watch - this one is, ahem, definitely worth a kiss.  "},{"Name":"Identity Card","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Tia Bajpai, Furqan Merchant, Saurabh Shukla, Vipin Sharma","Director":"Rahat Kazmi","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 30 minutes","Review":" TV journalist Nazia, her friend Ajay and local tourist guide Raju get abducted in Srinagar, only to find themselves locked in a Special Task Force (STF) cell. With no identity cards on them, rigorous interrogation sessions begin. While the trio claims innocence, the counter-terrorism unit thinks otherwise. Is this a case of mistaken identity or are the three really at fault?  movie  *Identity Card* predominantly tries to highlight human rights violations of Kashmiri civilians in the form of forced disappearances, torturous interrogations and extrajudicial killings. It also tries to comprehend the psyche of terrorists, police and the STF who struggle to differentiate between innocents and suspected insurgents, given the volatile circumstances.  However, Rahat Kazmi's ambitious film tries to bite off more than it can chew. While the director's intention is sincere and noble, he fails to evoke a reaction, owing to his vague execution. Performances are decent but they prove to be futile, given the incoherent script. Especially given the gravity of the topic, solid research was required. The climax too disappoints, given the characters' wishful thinking and over-simplistic conclusion.  Also, throughout the film, you keep wondering if it was intended to be a short dramedy or a gut-wrenching tale of suffering. In either case, it fails to make an impact. After all, you can't merely 'touch upon' an issue as sensitive and intricate as Kashmir.  We don't know about identity but the film lacks substance for sure.  "},{"Name":"Katiyabaaz","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Loha Singh","Director":"Deepti Kakkar, Fahad Mustafa","Genre":"Documentary","Duration":"1 hour 24 minutes","Review":" When circumstances push you way past your breaking point, can disobeying the law be justified? This conflict lies at the heart of this riveting docu-drama based on real events in Kanpur. Though it predominantly deals with something as serious as 'electricity theft', it never ceases to be a humane drama that is heartbreaking, yet funny at times.  movie  True to the title, the film's (self-proclaimed) 'hero' of sorts is local vigilante Loha Singh, who is a Katiyabaaz, Katiya being the wire used to steal electricity and Katiyabaaz, the expert electricity thief.  Plagued by poverty and power cuts which last for as long as 15 hours a day, Kanpurites prefer paying thieves like Loha to get illegal but instant electricity, as opposed to paying KESCO (Kanpur Electricity Supply Company Limited), which fails to meet their expectations.  On the other hand, due to poor billing and collection standards, lack of funds, soaring demand, inadequate power generation and meter tampering, KESCO has been making heavy losses.  To bring the situation under control, KESCO's MD Ritu Maheshwari tries her best to resolve the long-standing issues and generate revenue. She orders taking serious steps against the perpetrators and during the process, faces multiple challenges. Is there a solution to this rampant problem?  The film draws your attention to the reasons and repercussions of the critical crisis, instead of merely focusing on the illegalities, thus giving you the whole picture. Balanced in its approach, this is one of very few social issue-based films that dares to take sides. A tale of survival was never so poignant and entertaining, all at once.  Sensitively directed, realistically shot, Katiyabaaz will make you value the most basic thing your city provides you with, that you often take for granted - bijli.

Last week, it was Singham, who, in his khakis, returned to take the pants off corrupt politicians and god-men. And this week, it is Lady Singham or Shivani Shivaji Roy (Rani Mukerji), looking dapper, albeit briefly, in a police inspector's uniform, who wreaks havoc in Pradeep Sarkar's Mardaani.  movie  The film claims to be inspired by true events. However, for cinema-buffs, it's easier to trace the inspiration to several Hollywood thrillers, including the Liam Neeson one, Taken (2008). Like Neeson, a former CIA operative hunting down his daughter who is kidnapped by human traffickers for sexual slavery, Rani is a current-day crime branch inspector searching for a teenager who goes missing from a local Mumbai shelter. The young girl Pyaari (Priyanka Sharma) is someone whom Shivani treats like her own niece. Her sole objective in the film is to track down the men who have kidnapped the orphan and blow the lid off their sex racket.  As she engages in a thrilling encounter with the baddie Karan Rastogi (Tahir Raj Bhasin) in Mumbai and later in Delhi, you can sit back and enjoy the action. While there is nothing in the plot that you haven't seen before, it is still watchable for the superb performance of Rani, whose amber-coloured eyes breathe fire when she is packing those punches! And her unabashed use of Hindi expletives like 'chut**', 'madar****' should work with the lowest common denominator. The frequent *MCBCs* is the obvious reason for the adults-only tag.  This movie could have continuous recall had the pace been racier. And if you could also buy into the emotional tracks between Shivani and her husband, her niece or her ward. Also, Rani is the only member of the cast with star value. The rest of the actors, including the English-speaking young goon, are inconsequential.

Of course, these Hollywood films were way superior in every possible way but this one has its own twist or (the lack of it) and innocence.  movie  Set in Canada, 'Superman' fan-boy Raj (the lovelorn protagonist) works less and fantasizes more about his model-like crush Linda. On the other hand, 'temporary' wife Pia realizes she may have developed feelings for her 'husband'. What happens next and who gets whom forms the story.  Actor Manoj Amarnani juggles the multiple roles of director, background score composer, choreographer and stylist for the film. He dabbles in almost everything and in spite of being a newcomer, manages to make a film that is watchable if not memorable.  As far as the execution is concerned, the director's liking for the Yash Chopra-Karan Johar brand of cinema is evident. Colourful saris, romantic songs picturised in snowy locales and dream sequences are aplenty. The lead actors are easy on the eye and render decent performances, especially the hero who has potential but needs to work on his Hindi diction.  However, what works as a spoiler here is a pointless story that makes the romance look unconvincing. The film thus works as a comedy rather than a love story. But even the juvenile jokes, which predominantly revolve around Raj and his sidekick, get repetitive after a while.  The songs are the film's USP for they are melodious and have been sung by renowned singers like Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan and Shreya Ghoshal. 'Manzilein' in particular is hummable.  Overall, those who are obsessed with love stories, no matter how inconsequential or conventional they are, won't mind watching this one.

Yet his thrusts have a lot of pelvis. He 'locks', 'pops' and 'breaks'. He's fast, smooth and footloose. The heart of this story rests on the dance floor, but dares to step out too.  movie  Aarav Anand's (Saahil) life pirouettes on one big dream - he wants to join his idol Caesar's dance group. With little money and pounds of passion, he moves to the quaint town of Sheffield in UK to track down his dancing guru. He bonds with other struggling desis having similar woes of living in a phoren land. He traces Caesar and his troupe of sinister-looking white snobs, who hate the 'brownies' (\"Brownies are fit to be waiters, cabbies and caterers!\").  He even suffers a humiliating defeat in a dance battle and is ousted. He meets UK-born desi girl Aashira (Amrit) who hates the 'browns', but abruptly waltzes over to the other side, finds a partner in him and falls in love too. Aarav then forms the first Asian dance crew in Sheffield that participates in a fierce dance battle at the national level.  Debutant director Saahil Prem's film is simple with a formulaic story line. It doesn't ever 'step-up' to another level. It delves into issues beyond dance - racial conflict, youth dilemmas and dreams. While none of these sub-plots are well-fleshed out, they end up throwing the story off the dance floor.  Some dance routines (B-boying, locking, popping, break-dance, free-style - Salah Benlemqawanssa & Supple Nam - Kryptic Movement) will arouse cheers, and the dancers are undeniably impressive during the fiery dance face-offs. Yet, for a dance film, it lacks pace, energetic enthusiasm and a good soundtrack. The lead pair burns the dance floor, can't say the same about their romance. Most of the cast dances better than they emote.  Saahil strikes with aggressive moves, he's silently charming, but underplays his emotions. Amrit is smooth on the dance floor and likeable; Raashul Tandon (of the buddy gang) provides laughs.  'MAD' puts its best foot forward at the end, hold your breath for the last dance. Overall, it's a film for dance lovers. Even if it leaves the heart dancing for more.

The Singham is back. This time louder, wilder and more a man-eater. With his lioness in tow. For a roar in stereo. Yes, the 'hard-hitting' combo of Devgn-Shetty is back with more purr for the puss. With sculpted muscles and sinews that scream 'studly'. And the man with ultimate dum, fakth Bajirao Singham.  movie  The plot rumbles with action of seismic proportions, shot grandly in signature Shetty style - high-voltage stunts, death-defying combats, men and machines bursting into flames - served bloody, gritty and unadulterated. Guruji (Kher) is a righteous political leader who wants to bring about social change with youth development, women's safety, et al. Opposing his noble intentions are corrupt politicians and a sleazy, malicious godman, Swamiji (Gupte), who hypnotizes and loots the aam aadmi with blind faith.  Enter DCP Bajirao Singham (Devgn), with a satka dimaag and a solid mission. His dutiful police officer gets killed and falsely accused of corruption. Singham returns with more garam khoon than before. With all his claw-power to pound the baddies, even as his dynamite dialogues (Sajid-Farhad) dare them to resurrect their evil (aai shapath!).  Shetty's cracked the pulse of the masses as he brazenly plays to the galleries. While the story itself plays it safe (too basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty, Jai Singh Nijjar and Suniel Rodrigues). Also packing a social message and feeding action lovers with raw 'meat and bones'. It's riddled with cliches and the length needs a good edit. But overall, it provides entertainment for enthusiasts of 'Singham' brand of cinema.  Amol Gupte is perfectly cast, leaving an impact with a superb, killer performance. Kareena Kapoor (as Avni) playfully romances her sher, slipping in some laughs and clicking 'selfies' as Lady Singham. Kher is good even in a brief role. Devgn digs his claws into this part with more vengeance and power, delivering a knockout act.  The jungle can be tamed. If we all become ringmasters of the circus of civilization - and lions of what is right. Then the unlawful will get - well, fakth.

His father, Pannalal Johri (Dalip Tahil in a garlanded photo-frame on the wall), has bequeathed his wealth to his pet dog Entertainment (Junior), because he could not in his life-time locate his real son, Akhil Lokhande (Akshay Kumar).  movie  After a romantic interlude with his girlfriend Saakshi (Tamannaah) in Mumbai, Akhil flies to Bangkok. His best friend Jugnu (Krushna, good comic-tuning) and he make grand plans to get rid of the dog, who stands between him and his billions.  But the canine is nobody's fool. Man and beast find ways to outsmart each other and when they can't kill each other, they join forces. Here, a fresh set of villains, Prakash Raj and Sonu Sood, named Karan-Arjun (there are many stereotypes), are introduced. They, too, are eyeing the same pile of wealth. So now, Akhil and Entertainment have to get the better of the baddies.  Debutant-directors Sajid-Farhad, who have the dubious distinction of having written very successful Bollywood no-brainers like the Golmaal series, Dhamaal, and Housefull 2, and who have salvaged themselves to a degree by writing the Singham films, could have salvaged their first directorial venture by keeping it tight, despite the stereotypes.  However, because the jokes are repetitive by nature, the LOL (laugh-out-loud) moments are few and far between. The dialogue, which uses Bollywood actor-director names like, \"I so Rajani-can't\", does get guffaws. But for the most part, the humour is for the child in you.  Akshay Kumar is in top form. Having done a multitude of masala movies, he's become a khiladi. His bonding with the dog (especially in comic scenes) has those 'oh-so-cute' moments. The golden retriever is not a wonderful actor; but his eyes can melt your heart.

However, for a change, we have a film which attempts to expose Gujarat's ugly underbelly.  Set in the 80's, the film revolves around the underworld's nexus with politicians and the police in Gujarat. How Latif (Hameed Khan) emerged as the crime-lord and why he was revered by his followers, before being killed in an encounter by the Ahmedabad police, forms the story.  We're also told about Latif's political networking, dominance in the bootlegging trade and association with Dawood Ibrahim.  The intention behind making this film is sincere but acting, production values and storytelling fail to make you feel invested in it. You don't feel for the central character, unlike past films like Dayavan or Haji Mastan in Once Upon a Time in Mumbai. The execution lacks the tension, pace, continuity and emotional connect required for a film of this genre.  The lead actor fails to do justice to his infamous character as he lacks screen presence. The twist in the end doesn't evoke any reaction either.  To sum it up, you appreciate the makers for bringing this untold real-life story to celluloid. But at the end of the day, a biopic must affect you in some way, which doesn't happen here.

Kick is not for lovers of fine filmi foie gras, but for those who want a hearty Eid banquet to enjoy.  movie  Shy Shaina (Jacqueline) meets eccentric Devi Lal (Salman) who will do anything - including beat up eve-teasing \"micro-terrorists ki gang\" - for a kick. The couple's love blossoms in a blaze of golden confetti but withers as Devi is unwilling to hold down boring jobs despite Shaina - who is a \"magaz ki doctor\" or psychiatrist - pleading.  As Devi walks away, even hot Inspector Himanshu (Randeep), who visits Shaina and her diplomat dad (Saurabh Shukla) in Poland, is unable to charm the broken-hearted girl. What happens when an amnesia-struck Devi shows up? And when he mysteriously appears in the super-robbery case Himanshu's determined to crack?  Kick is vintage Salman Khan, the star flipping from fun-loving Devi to dead-serious Devil with goofy, yet deadly grace. Salman's clearly having fun here - he drawls, \"Meri cat, mujhi pe attack\" with creamy cattiness, while in the stiltedly sexy Marjawan featuring Nargis Fakhri, where he's togged up as a devil, Salman grins sideways, as if he knows just how ridiculous this is. But if Salman's getting his kicks, so are the others. Randeep Hooda matches Salman with his restrained, velveteen performance as Inspector Himanshu whose coat, he explains, \"isn't Armani but sarkaari\", while Jacqueline is best-in-lipsticks so far this year, carrying off librarian-hot with grace, her Shaina beautifully elegant - until she throws off her jacket and burns the screen in Jumme ki Raat.  As Shiv Gajra, criminal head of a charitable trust, Nawazuddin tries too hard to be bad. His Faster Fenay-like 'tock' and hammy laugh get on your nerves but his role's sharp and small, restricted to \"Pollen-d\" and a bank sequence with, well, a shocking end.  But shocks aside, Kick has laughs too. A jail sequence involving Devi's pitaji (Mithun) is LOL-hilarious while there's unintended comedy too, including animation featuring Salman with a body suspiciously like Hrithik's and a Polish chase sequence involving a London Kings Cross bus. At times, the plot resembles the bus itself, wobbling madly until the next killer line.  However, these are small quibbles in a fun film. As Devi would say, \"Dr. Psycho, chillati kaiko?\" Just enjoy this cheese-Kick.

What it lacks is an A-grade star cast. Also, this one is slightly more predictable in pattern. However, the doses of erotica added to the screenplay just to give it that gleeful taste work well.  movie  Sonika (Surveen Chawla) with an hourglass figure is the mistress of a powerful politician, Mandar Mhatre (Sushant Singh). But at heart, she is a simple girl who wants a chance to taste real love. A fellow-photography student Akshay (Jay Bhanushali) and she fall head over heels in love. And though she warns him of her 'tainted' image, his intentions stay honourable.  The two elope and set up their paradise away from the prying eyes of the power-drunk politician. They hum Arijit Singh's truly melodious Aaaj phir tumse pyaar, lock lips passionately and make steamy love. And, just when you're feasting your eyes on Surveen's dusky bare skin, the bad guys find them. What follows from here is the real suspense tale.  The lead pair Jay and Surveen, both of whom have an ardent following on the small screen, pass muster in their movie outing as well. However, the scene-stealer is the antagonist, Sushant Singh, who delivers a powerful performance.  On the flip side, the proceedings on screen lack tempo that is needed for an erotic thriller. However, to stop you from fidgeting, the makers have cleverly roped in adult-star Sunny Leone (Indian cinema's best import in recent times) to shimmy. She beckons you to look at her pink lips in an item number.  So, even if the plot points in this vendetta drama seem asinine, with Surveen, Sunny and sex thrown in, the less pretentious will go home satiated.

While RGV's version had 'Sarkar' played by Amitabh Bachchan, Riyasat's ethical Godfather is an ageing Saheb (Rajesh Khanna), who rules the underworld but helps the poor by guaranteeing them money, safety and justice.  movie  His henchman is his elder son Shakti (Aryan Vaid), heir to his crime empire. Younger son Vijay (Aryeman Ramsay) has no interest whatsoever in his family business but obviously, things change.  If you are planning to watch this film solely for Rajesh Khanna, don't. He looks unwell, can barely speak and thus seems to have been given very few dialogues. He avoids eye contact with co-stars and the camera. Loud music is played in the background every time he appears onscreen in order to make things intense but that fails. Since he looks totally detached and disinterested in the film, you wonder why he did it in the first place.  Besides, the story proceeds unhurriedly and tests your patience. Almost every actor takes ages to finish a sentence. And the silence doesn't speak volumes, as was the case in The Godfather.  Aryan Vaid and Aryeman Ramsay are decent. The latter even sounds like Abhishek Bachchan. Guess that was the reason why he was chosen for that part. But the filmmaker is unable to create an aura around Saheb, which is the biggest drawback. He doesn't look menacing or mighty either. To sum it up, this is a poor tribute to the late superstar. You don't want to see him like that.

Barring a few classics like RGV's Bhoot, Kaun and the comparatively recent 13B, the genre stays untapped here. In fact, most Hindi horror films make you laugh with tacky special effects and unintentional humour.  movie  This Hindi adaptation of a Tamil film (by the same name) breaks the jinx. From solid sound effects, usage of graphics in the opening credits and decent 3D to effective non-dramatic performances, the director manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. In times when you are bombarded with hackneyed plots, Pizza is refreshingly real.  Right in the beginning, Nikita (Parvathy Omanakuttan) a struggling horror fiction writer, tells her agnostic husband Kunal (Akshay Oberoi) that he will have his 'moment of fear' someday. Kunal, who delivers pizza for a living, brushes off the thought knowing he may have to encounter it eventually and he does. He then finds himself mysteriously trapped in an obscure house. Unnatural deaths occur and his hide-and-seek with death begins...  Pizza has all the ingredients in the right amount, required for the making of a taut thriller. It is tense, gripping and atmospheric. No usual 'shutting and opening of doors on their own' business happens here. We are spared the cliches. Smartly written and well-executed, it also boasts of a solid climax which is thankfully not an anti-climax.  While the build-up will leave you sweating and gasping for breath, the unfolding of events manages to sustain the tension created. By infusing multiple twists and turns in the story, the director keeps you guessing till the end and that's the beauty of the film.  Lead actors Akshay Oberoi and former Miss India Parvathy Omanakuttan do complete justice to the spine-chilling story with their compelling presence. We would like to see these actors more often on screen. The supporting cast is equally competent.  The faint-hearted can stay away for the film does get immensely eerie. The rest should watch it for it's one of the most unpredictable thrillers you will see in a long time.

With his sharp wit and refreshing nonchalance, Virr Das in the titular role brings out the irony of the situation effortlessly. He makes a list of qualities that his lady love must possess. In a hilarious opening scene, he even dumps a girl for not liking Sachin Tendulkar. And since 'opposites attract', he falls for a free-spirited Mala (Vega Tamotia). But Cupid plays a cruel game when Devika (Anindita Nayar), the girl of Amit's dreams (read list), comes into his life soon after.  movie  The protagonist's self-talk and confused state of mind will remind you of Saif Ali Khan in Kal Ho Naa Ho. But Virr Das adds his own unique sensibility to the character, which works. He proves why Bollywood should go beyond the star kids, Khans and Kapoors and give non-filmi talent its due. The highlight of the film is a scene where a 'break-up consultant' gives a presentation on why a couple should part ways. It epitomises how romance has gone out of the window and how cynical we have become in times of smart-phones and social media. However, ASKL has its share of drawbacks, if not deal-breakers. In spite of the smart comic punches, timing and earnest performances, the story lacks the ability to engage you thoroughly. A few scenes (Amit seeking relationship advice from his best friend) seem unfunny. Songs are pointless. Also, the story moves at a lethargic pace and it gets to you since you can predict the ending. Mismatch or Miss Right? Instead of waiting for that 'perfect rom-com', you can give this a try.

His mother consoles him by leading him on to believe that he is 'sundar' (good looking). She also tells him that one day he'll marry a pretty 'memsaab' (by pointing to a poster of Rani Mukerji).  However, the very next minute, she explains her interpretation of 'memsaab' by showing his son another gori mem (tourist) passing by. 'Someone like her' she says. He says, \"Main aisi hi memsaab se saadi karunga.\"  Munna grows up but continues to nurture his dream of getting married to a gori mem, just to make his mother happy. He leaves his village and lands up in a city to fulfil his dream. With great audacity, he proposes marriage to random urban women but his requests get turned down. However, there is light at the end of every tunnel. He eventually bumps into a Katrina Kaif-like firang memsaab. Do they fall in love?  Ample Hindi films with a similar concept have been made before and they were much better if not remarkable. For instance, Govinda-Aishwarya Rai starrer Albela (2001) was a light-hearted romcom that made us smile.  While the intentions are noble here, tacky execution spoils everything. Forced humour fails to amuse and funny sounds used as background score do not compensate for the poor script. The point that the director intends to make does not come across either. His attempt at exposing the shallow-ness of our society that prefers 'good-looking' people fails to register.  Also, performances are forgettable. The gori mem is the best actor here! Songs have no relevance to the story. There is no 'beauty' in this film...literally and otherwise.

Maybe that's why his nick is 'Humpty'. Typical Delhi ka munda, part-dilwala, part-gunda. So we have a classic 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge' in the mix. Fast-forwarded to today (18 years later). Where love is a 'Facebook' post and the generational shift allows you to 'makeout' with your gal and smoke-up with your papaji-in-law-to-be. All is cool!  movie  Yet, at its core, the story retains its roots in the chhotta-chhotta shehers its set in. The 'surround sound' coming from a big-fat-Punjabi -wedding with the usual paajis, vijis, bijis, maajis ... Oh-ji!  The dulhania here is an Ambala girl, with oodles of attitude - Kavya Singh (Alia) - who agrees to marry NRI boy Angad (Sidharth) of her bullying bauji's (Ashutosh) choice. Her demand is a Kareena Kapoor style designer lehenga (even the couture has caught up with time). Kavya takes off to Delhi to buy her shaadi-ka-joda, where she meets Humpty (Varun); their love blossoms over party-sharty (she slips out of *patialas* and downs the 'pegs'), coffee, cuddles and conversations.  But Humpty has to win over the stubborn Singh sir - and break this 'tailor-made' wedding with a 'designer dulha' - to take home his dulhania. And he will go as far as pickling desi achaar for the girl - only to please papa.  The strength of Shashank's debut film (tribute to 'DDLJ') is the performances and characters, whether it is Humpty-Kavya's cutesy, charming chemistry or the unbeatable boy-gang bonding with Shonty and Poplu (Saahil Vaid - howlarious act!).  Unlike the characters, the story doesn't enthuse or grow beyond the original plot, but it's pinned with warm, delightful moments and laughable dialogues. The music is average. Alia is spunky, spontaneous and simply superb. Varun has put all heart into this role; he doesn't let Humpty fall even for a moment. Sidharth looks smashing, but doesn't get much scope (disappearing without a warning), while Ashutosh shines through.  HSKD has plenty of feel-good moments, but nothing that will leave you punch-drunk. For romantics who believe in their dils and their dulhanias.  "},{"Name":"Bobby Jasoos","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Vidya Balan, Ali Fazal, Supriya Pathak, Tanvi Azmi, Arjan Bajwa, Kiran Kumar","Director":"Samar Shaikh","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 1 minute","Review":" So, Bobby Jasoos is a Hyderabadi pearl of a movie, worn with terrific aplomb by its star Vidya Balan. Playing the 30-year-old Bilquis or Bobby, who has no detective course but fearless passion, Vidya dazzles as Bobby Jasoos, tracking mysteries as a buck-toothed palmist, a dreadlocked sadhu, a hobbling fakir - suddenly distilled into a tongue-tied girl who discovers love.  movie  Bobby lives in Mughalpura's tight, twisting lanes, supported by her adoring mother Zebo (Pathak), censured by her stern father, criticized by her marriage-arranger aunt. Bobby's determined to crack cases and make her family proud - but what happens when a rich stranger Anees Khan (Kumar) hires her to track young girls? And when she finds herself engaged to cocky TV star Tasavvur (Ali) - who wants her to reject him?  Vidya runs away with Bobby Jasoos. She is both the film's hero and heroine, performing with deft innocence, presenting Bobby like a breeze. But her leading man Tasavvur is also nailed by Ali Fazal, who captures the 'Alert India!' star's urge for 'lifestyle banana' with the comedy of getting hooked to madcap Bobby - and the sudden, delicate power of discovering love. Ali impresses with his acting while Arjan Bajwa, as local goonda Lala, impresses with his smouldering looks, soorma and stubble making Bajwa steamier than ever before.  Alongside, supporting actors lend colour to the canvas, Tanvi Azmi standing out in a small, sharp role as Bobby's tart-tongued khaala, Rajendra Gupta credible as Bobby's disgruntled dad, the jasoos' merry men, Shetty, Munna and Suhail, leaving a fine imprint upon the tale. The cinematography delights - with the steam from chai escaping into an afternoon of green-leafed rain, Bobby Jasoos clearly boasts a cinematographer (Vishal Sinha) who thinks. With a music director (Shantanu Moitra) who feels, his score unobtrusive, yet pleasing, 'Arziyaan de raha dil' specially exquisite.  There are slight drawbacks - the acting sometimes slips into sit-com mode while the second half relaxes where it could've been more taut. But quibbles aside, Bobby Jasoos is a clever and joyful film. Should you watch it?  Elementary, my dear friend.  "},{"Name":"Lekar Hum Deewana Dil","Release Time":"Apr 13 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Armaan Jain, Deeksha Seth, Akhil Iyer","Director":"Arif Ali","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours 20 minutes","Review":" Debutant director Arif Ali's Lekar Hum Deewana Dil is a sweet film that borrows the elopement theory from evergreen 70s'-80s' romances like Bobby, Love Story and Betaab. It even has shades of Arif's older brother Imtiaz's Jab We Met and Highway. But this has a mint-crisp feel with its .com lingo. The lack of melodrama, for most part of the movie, is also refreshing.  movie  Dinoo (Armaan) and Karishma (Deeksha) are collegians who haven't scratched the surface of their feelings for each other. They're happy sipping strawberry milkshakes with buddies. But when the Shetty girl's obstinate businessman dad wants her to marry a groom of his choice from within their community, she flips. On cue, good friend Dinoo and she fly the coup, also remembering to adopt a stray along the way.  Taking their deewana dil along and as is suggested in the Yaadon Ki Baaraat ditty, they go manzil manzil.  On the journey from Mumbai to Goa, over bottles of beer and zany nocturnal adventures, they swear undying love. As relatives attempt to hunt them down, the couple also safeguards itself with a chat mangni-pat shaadi without band, baaja and baaraat. The start of their idyllic life together is blissful because the girl's every wish is the young boy's command.  But when they run short on budgets, land in Naxalite territory (a strange detour with a raunchy item song - Mawaali Qawaali - thrown in), the screenplay takes an interesting twist.  AR Rahman lifts spirits with the club number Khalifa Khalifa and draws sighs with the poignant Alaahada. Armaan is endearing and energetic, getting you to warm up to him. Deeksha is confident and likeable. Bangalore boy Mahesh (Akhil) excels. And if you're looking to cuddle up this monsoon just like the slightly mismatched young couple in the movie, attempt doing it the LHDD way.

Till the effervescent, virginal Aisha (Shraddha), a Good Samaritan, crosses his path. Opposite attract. His gun goes silent as the two of them chase the rainbow together. The texture of their relationship has that fairy-tale quality. And just when they start to build their castle, brick by brick, their life is stopped on the tracks by a psychotic serial killer Rakesh (Riteish).  movie  Guru, who had dropped his gun in exchange for a bed of roses with Aisha, rediscovers metal. Inspired largely by Korean filmmaker Kim Jee-Woon's I Saw the Devil (2010), Mohit Suri's romantic thriller is Bollywoodised for the desi market.  While the Korean film relied on too much blood and gore, Suri's film mixes romance and violence in equal measure, letting the plot meander a bit butallowing for some sharp twists as well. So there are those sweet moments interspersed with the melodious galliyan track rendered beautifully by Ankit Tewari. And there are also those look-over-your-shoulder thrills because suddenly, you have not one, but two villains running amok on screen. The cat and mouse game between the two bad men is exciting. However, there is some repeated violence that makes you squirm and wish that the writer had kept the plot tighter.  Sidharth kills with his good looks and delivers an angry man performance deftly; Riteish strikes the right amount of fear in his maniacal gear. Shraddha is bubbly and achingly beautiful. But the supporting cast should have been chosen more discerningly. Aamna Sharif as Riteish's nagging wife is an irritant and Remo Fernandes as the mafia don should definitely have had more menace.  You cannot fault the scale of Ek Villain or berate its lead star cast. But you wish you could celebrate this thriller like you did Suri's last movie outing Aashiqui 2. This one lacks soul.

Humshakals features an odd balance between brilliant jokes, followed by a pajama party of PJs. Ashok (Khan) is a London billionaire whose day job is \"business umpire sambhalna\" but who does cringe-worthy comedy which even his buddy Kumar (Deshmukh) can't bear.  movie  Fortunately, TV star Shanaya (Bhatia) finds Ashok funny which has him smiling until his wicked mama Kunwar Amar Nath Singh - aka Kans - slips him a 'Mad - mind-altering drug', making Ashok and Kumar go doggy-style, landing up in 'Lord Cray G. Mental Asylum'. As Dr. Shivani (Gupta) and manager Mishti (Basu) aid them, Kans mama thinks he's won the corporate board game - but Ashok and Kumar discover helpful humshakals. What happens when mamaji's humshakal also arrives?  With its convoluted plot, Humshakals needs terrific acting - and the actors deliver. As three variants of Ashok - original, insane, effeminate, plus a girl role too - Saif runs away with Humshakals. Khan surprises with his flair for twinkling-eyed, giggle-voiced, mincing-step comedy, delivering lines like \"Shet up, scoundrel!\" with liquid ease. As three-Kumar, Deshmukh's fun, doing a memorable Dilip Kumar over, well, vodka ke paranthe. Playing Kans mama, Ram Kapoor performs with velveteen wickedness, even shaking a waxy leg as a 'kali-flower' on a beach. The boys have a ball but the ladies are as wasted as icing sugar on a layered cake.  Meanwhile, with its multi-story story, Humshakals must be tightly told. Here, the film wobbles, its first half distractedly meandering with mindless sequences involving comas, electric shocks and Satish Shah as a Hitler-worshipping warden, tormenting patients by showing them Himmatwala. The second half gets tauter and funnier with an uncommon House of Commons involving the three duos, Prince Charles and Chunky Pandey as a drug lord. This tootie-fruity climax is clearly Sajid Khan's revenge for empire - the cut-rate Prince Charles barks, \"Kyah baath kar rahe ho?\" and bombs tick. The comedy could've tickled had the plot not faltered again, throwing in a dull diversion involving dwarves.  The result's like a minty chewing gum that's been stretched too long. Shedding 30 minutes and some jaded gags would make Humshakals consistent fun - now, you laugh but also frequently go, ho-hum.

This film draws inspiration from it and goes a step further as it offers an anti-bomb blast solution.  The film has its heart in the right place but the execution is way too idealistic and far-fetched for your liking. Terrorism is too intricate an issue to be dealt with so lightly. We are sure the real terrorists don't hold placards, acknowledging their identity! You see that happening here. Some men with Afghan accents are shown chanting 'terrorism zindabad' slogans, which is insanely naive and quite hilarious.  Also, the excessive preachiness gets annoying after a while. Dialogues like, \"I am Indian, imaandari is a national virtue, desh bhakti, desh ki seva\" are used frequently. These lines exceed action. Every character speaks a lot but does nothing. Also, the songs are terribly placed.  Lead actor Rehal Khan has a good presence but the highly ambitious story fails him. Nipon Goswami, Gulshan Grover and Mukesh Tiwari act well in their supporting roles.  The film had potential, decent production values but merging science and crime wasn't a smart decision after all.

They are put up at a spacious guest house in a deserted location. In no time, Ayesha senses a mysterious presence in the house. Nightmares, hallucinations, creepy noises, paranormal occurrences and shadows start plaguing her. Scared for her family, she pleads her husband to vacate the house but he blames it on her mind games. What's the truth?  movie  Novelty cannot be expected much in horror, given the nature of the genre. But if the cliched scenes manage to scare you, the job is done. Machhli Jal Ki Rani Hai has a formulaic premise too - a woman alone in a haunted house, doors shutting by themselves, mysterious gory deaths, 'I-believe-in-ghosts' maid and an exorcism in the climax. While the film has incorporated all the elements possible, it struggles to maintain tension. The focus diverts from ghost presence and possession to the couple hosting dinner parties for their friends. Inclusion of other insignificant characters adds to the length and take away from the content, thus weakening the plot. Sound effects are strictly average.  While Swara Bhaskar is impressive in her first horror film, her performance fails to compensate the director's disjointed execution. Bhanu Uday is decent too.  If you get spooked easily, you may not mind this one. If you like horror, watch Insidious (2010) or Ram Gopal Varma's Bhoot (2003) again. Those are classics.

F*ugly had sharp potential - a dramatic story, a fresh cast, a velveteen character actor and gritty city Delhi. But instead of weaving a tightly-knit drama, these become loose threads.  movie  Dev (Marwah), Devi (Advani), Gaurav (Singh) and Aditya (Lamba) are fast friends living life, as Dev says, \"on speed and loving it\". Foot-loose and fancy-free, the Delhi foursome drives around town, drinking, partying and cussing. They pop across to Leh where Dev starts a tourist camp, then return home where Devi helps her mother (Kunika) sell papads to the lecherous Nannu (Pravin Singh Sisodia in a strikingly creepy role), Gaurav trains as a boxer under the indulgent eye of his Haryanvi politician father and Aditya learns the family sanitary-ware trade. Life rolls along in a swill of swearwords and vodka until the four collide with corrupt cop Chautala (Shergill) and a crime occurs. Can the friends survive?  F*ugly's determination to be off-the-wall makes it fall flat. The film gets overburdened trying to capture every Delhi cliche, from Parliament to Paharganj, and show how deep the city's ugliness has seeped. The story has its moments - Shergill's menacing Chautala is etched in iron while Vijender Singh is funny and bright. Marwah's Dev has soulful presence while Advani's Devi alternates well between fiery and fragile. However, in trying to present an uber-cool tale, the acting is overlooked and inconsistent. Similarly, there are striking side-stories here - Gaurav's family's internal politics - but the direction fails to fuse together a powerful, coherent film, the distracted screen efforts unaided by forgettable music.  The result is like a soggy Delhi chaat where potentially spicy ingredients make a sorry mess. As F*ugly would phrase it, quite a f*waste.

All hell breaks loose when the crooks are charged with the murder of an MLA - a crime they haven't committed. Can they prove their innocence to the cops?  movie  Chal Bhaag attempts to shed light on a serious issue like the police's fake encounters. While the motive and twists in the story are interesting, the comic execution ruins it. You don't see any humour in the situations or the characters. It's tragic, in fact, and the film would have still worked had it been a black comedy.  The gravity of the situation comes across in a light-hearted manner initially but the randomness of it all, introduction of multiple characters, inconsequential dialogues, etc., convolutes the paper-thin plot. Item numbers further make the formulaic film forgettable. Drawbacks can be overlooked if the film manages to hold your attention. Here, it partially does but the forced humour doesn't help.

Hell's bells, they're far from 'sleeping beauties'. But then they have to make our brave-heart Virat Bakshi (Akshay) look good. And he sure does. In his camouflage suits and his neon bermudas. Whether he's on a secret mission (as Defence Intelligence Agent), or romancing his boisterous 'boxer' belle Saiba (Sonakshi). All the while coaching his cop buddy on how to 'crack a case', or saluting his boss sergeant (Govinda, in a cutesy cameo).  movie  Virat's on holiday in Mumbai - 'ladki dekhne' - where a terror blast kills school kids in a bus. A suspect is caught and it leads to series of more suspects who're part of a devious demolition plan by - Sleeper Cells (trained terrorists guised as common men in society). His holiday turns into havoc and Virat becomes a one-man army - who has to raze the terror outfit and salvage Mumbai from exploding into flames. Nothing can break this lion-hearted soldier who upholds his valour, wardi and values - like a true jawan.  Murgadoss' film (remake of the Tamil 'Thupakki') offers an intelligent plot, with blows, blasts and raw bone-cracking action (Greg Powell- of 'Skyfall' fame). It triggers a fear that anyone from your paanwala to pizza-delivery boy could be a 'closet' terrorist (Beware!).  While the core plot is compelling and finely directed, the side-tracks - like bombs needing to be deactivated and the romantic angle, waste screen-time and the songs infiltrate the plot too often. The film is too long and needs a taut edit. It has flaws too, but doesn't fail to entertain.  Akshay's stunts are jaw-dropping; he's in top form and impressively leads the show without much support from his squadron of actors. Farhad (the lead villain) doesn't leave much impact; and Sonakshi slides in for the song and dance.  This one applauds the jawans who live in the jaws of death, and is a 'wake up' call for all the 'sleepers' that abound. Bravo!

A place where only Bollywood runs in the bloodstream (maa kasam!).  movie  Sunny (Sharib), an obsessive Bollywood addict, briefly abandons his acting aspirations and becomes an assistant director for an American crew shooting a documentary in Rajasthan (close to the Indo-Pak border). A terrorist group intending to kidnap the Amreekis mistakenly capture Sunny. He's held hostage in Pakistan, there he befriends Aftab (Innamulhaq) who makes a living out of selling pirated Bollywood movies. A 'Sholay'-like' undying brotherhood is born out of pure pyaar for Bollywood. But the boss of the terrorists Mehmood (Mishra - intense and electric) has differences of opinion with this so called 'infidel', even as he's baffled at his Bollywood bhakti.  Whether it's Sunny's naivete or nerve - he never loses hope (even as a dhai kilo ka haath lands on him, he says,\"Mard ko dard nahin hota\"), letting his filmigiri fuel his courage. Debut director Kakkar spins some remarkable moments when Sunny directs his own 'ransom' video with multiple retakes; his conversations with Mehmood over Tendulkar v/s Afridi followed by a wild victory dance. Sunny parroting Salman's dialogues from 'Maine Pyar Kiya', and his filmi impersonations of superstars and their iconic dialogues are hilarious.  In this National Award winning film, Kakkar subtly laces the scars of Indo-Pak hostility with humour and satire, while beautifully making way for all the malice to melt over undivided love for movies. It's slightly stretched in parts; Arijit Datta's music blends well. Sharib in a superlative act completely surrenders to the role and Innamulhaq piques the emotions with perfection. The camaraderie between the pure souls who understand only the language of Bollywood is heart-warming. Datt, with few dialogues, is deadly.  In a nation of star-worshippers, this film devoid of superstars brilliantly stands out. Aaj khush toh bahut hain hum! Ab bas, tareef pe tareef...

This is both a strength and drawback for this remarkable film. Deepak Singh (Rao) loses his village shop to debt and migrates to Mumbai with wife Rakhi (Patraleka) and child Mahi for a new start, ostensibly provided by friend Omkar. But reaching Mumbai, the family never finds Omkar. Instead, Deepak and Rakhi find tricksters, bar-girls, criminals, armoured guards - and a devious plot. Can this little family survive the big city?  movie  Citylights' performances glow. Rao is actually breath-taking in the quietest way, playing a man so simple, you feel his innocence. Far from dramatic fireworks, there are little touches - Deepak's nod when his daughter kisses him, an unsaid, adoring sigh - that cover this character with soulful sheen and maddening naivete. Patraleka's Rakhi is an excellent counterbalance. There are scenes - sad, unspeaking eyes over a sequined saree - where Patraleka astonishes. Alongside, Deepak's new-found mentor, 'Vishnu sir' (Kaul), supervisor at a security firm, crackles like a live-wire in a dark night, exuding city-slicker smarts, coiled tension and sudden warmth.  Alongside, the cinematography is wonderful. Shots of the family sleeping against a rubbish pile, a '3BHK' in a construction site, Deepak staring at an ocean of pure despair, a fallen cycle in a courtyard, stand out. The family's migration stays with you as a vivid new experience - but its city sojourn occasionally reminds you of familiar moments. An interview scene recalls Satyajit Ray's Pratidwandi while Citylights seems to acknowledge other masterful takes, from Dibakar Banerjee to Madhur Bhandarkar, on life in India's toughest town.  The second half thus gently meanders, shots becoming slightly repetitive and slow, making you agree when Vishnu tells Deepak in exasperated humour, \"Aap itni dheemi gati ke film hain!\" But the end gathers itself, providing a twist that both dazzles and covers darkness.  Quite like city lights.

With a young, fresh star-cast - minus frills and fanfare. No mundas baring bronzed six-pack bods or gori mundis dancing to disco bhangra, 'Yo-Yo' style (Hadippa!). It's as simple as aloo paratha with lassi. Gettit?  Meet Kuku Mathur (Siddharth) a naive, middle-class Delhi boy (a bin maa ka ladka) living with his strict father who has scholarly ambitions for him, but Kuku dreams of opening his own restaurant. Ronnie (Ashish), his dhai-baje-waala friend (desi 4 AM, eh!) is more easy-going and street-smart. Their only adolescent addiction is drinking fruit-beer in a sari ka godown. After 12th grade, Kuku lands a spot boy's job in a shady film unit after much struggle. Meanwhile, Ronnie gets so busy in his family 'blouse-piece' business that he snubs his buddy.  movie  Soon, it leads to a bitter fight and Kuku's life falls apart. Enter, smooth-talker, Kanpur ke Prabhakar bhaiyya (Amit) - a man who has a devious solution for every problem. A flutter of madness follows and good boy Kuku gets 'cuckooed'. Simply put, Kuku ki jhand ho jaati hai!  Sachdeva's plot is straightforward. The story doesn't offer much, but it's the jhund of characters that make you chortle with their spontaneous lines and lingo. The warehouse guard's mobiliya (telephonic) romance with his gharwali, a phony godman who sells spirituality ('Mata ka Jagran - Season 2') and digital divinity (he's available on WhatsApp and FB!). An OTT director's film called 'Facebook Pe Pyaar' ('Like' it?), and of course, Prabhakar (in a fine act) totally entertains.  Funny situations and scenes with quirky characters provide clean humour but that can't substitute for the lack of a good, engaging story.

The action is in 'Jat-land' where rural lord Choudhary Suraj Singh (Raj) is celebrating the arranged marriage of his daughter Renu (Dhar). The wedding's high Haryanvi style, all celebratory bullets and booze, chowmein eaten with dhai-kilo hands and relatives including an encounter specialist cop, a land shark badmaash and king of Delhi's bouncers. But the 'Kala Kutta' dries up when Renu elopes with Rakesh. In pursuit, her enraged relations capture Rakesh's buddies - including Bablu (Shroff) who pummels the Haryanvis hard. Bablu's fists stop flying when Dimpy - Suraj Singh's younger daughter - arrives. Will his heroics win?  movie  Heropanti captures the colourful tension of Haryanvi life, switching between the freedoms of big-city living to the cloistered comfort of a haveli, where one step out of tradition can lead an adored daughter to death. Raj portrays a father's hammy but dramatic agony while various mamas, taus and Dimpy's fiance Rajjo (Singh) mix muscular menace and rustic comedy well. They're matched at every mukka by Tiger Shroff, whose fighting and dancing feature commendable grace. Tiger has a pleasant, dignified presence but is clearly more comfortable letting his kicks, not his acting, talk. Playing Dimpy, who dreams of being 'Miss Haryana', Kriti has statuesque beauty but set expressions, the lead pair's emoting more cheesy than sharp.  Similarly, the story carries some corny 1990s flab, including a song-in- the-snow where the lovers wear colour co-ordinated clothing and Tiger sports a truly awful pair of blue goggles. More snags detract from otherwise tight direction - the Renu-Rakesh dilemma is left under-explained while overdone comedians (including an eloping driver and a chubby NRI) induce more yawns than chuckles.  Still, Heropanti is enjoyable. The climax pumps up the action, featuring shirtless Tiger, crouching Rajjo. The tale has a twist as graceful as Tiger's flips and you do agree when Tiger suggests, 'Mere naal tu whistle baja.'  "},{"Name":"Kochadaiiyaan","Release Time":"Apr 25 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Rajinikanth, Deepika Padukone, Nasser, Jackie Shroff, Sarath Kumar, Aadhi, Shobana, Nagesh","Director":"Soundarya Rajnikanth Ashwin","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"1 hour 50 minutes","Review":" Kochadaiiyaan opens with a prologue that tells us the two kingdoms, Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, have been at war with one another for generations. We see a boy from Kottaipattinam, who is about to drown, being rescued and the boy, Rana, grows up to become a soldier in Kalingapuri.  He earns the friendship of the prince Veera Mahendran and is made general of its army. He seeks the king's permission to attack their enemy nation but on the battlefield, Rana reveals himself to be the son of Kochadaiiyaan, the famed general of Kottaipattinam, and admits he enacted a drama to rescue the soldiers of his motherland being held as slave labourers.  movie  Rana is received with joy by his king and even gets him to marry the prince to his sister, but he also has an ulterior motive — to kill the king, who had unfairly sentenced his father to death.  Kochadiiyaan succeeds not because of technology but because of the writing. The film is motion capture 3D computer-animated but the animation is primeval; both the motion capture and the texture of the visuals are closer to The Polar Express than Avatar or Tintin. The long shots aren't problematic but whenever the camera cuts to a close-up, we are drawn to the inanimate nature of the expressions. The characters feel like caricatures of the real-life actors we have known. The movements of the actors too are robotic (in dance numbers, it feels like the characters are doing yoga) and the detailing is far from perfect, especially for characters in the background.  There is also inconsistency in the animation. Some scenes seem to have sheen while in some, the perspective fluctuates; there are times when a boulder looks as big as the man standing on it and blades of grass look like miniature paddy plants. But the sweeping camera work, the proficient voice-over work by actors and the energetic background score compensate for these blemishes.  Once the plot kicks into gear, the narration starts to hold our attention. The songs and stunts are woven into the story and do not stick out. Like any other Rajini movie, Kochadaiiyaan too worships its star. His character appears in almost every scene and there are fan-pleasing moments in the form of stylistic gestures and dialogues.  The story initially seems like a typical revenge fantasy but soon, we realize it is a bit more complex than that. The film actually ends by leaving its lead character in a moral dilemma. His family has served and protected the king for generations but now, the son has acted otherwise.  What fate does his action beget him? What happened to Rana's elder brother who vanished mysteriously? Where is his friend who abdicated the throne to marry the girl he loved? Will the enemy prince return? With such interesting questions, Soundarya has set up the knot for a deserving sequel.  "},{"Name":"Midsummer Midnight Mumbai","Release Time":"Apr 25 2016","Critic rating":"1.0/5","Cast":"Sara Khan, Paras Chhabra","Director":"Braj Bhushan","Genre":"Mystery","Duration":"2 hours 15 minutes","Review":" The film begins well. The events manage to keep you intrigued and seek truth just like ACP Ajay (unintentionally funny cop, who says 'posisun' for position and 'investigasun' for investigation). Just when you feel that M3 might turn out to be a decent 'whodunit', the film changes its genre and becomes an inconsequential love triangle.  From cops interrogating suspects, we are suddenly transported to multiple songs (all dream sequences) and in no time, everyone forgets about the paranormal case. Worse is when the mystery unfolds. In order to make the climax unpredictable, the writer forgot to connect it with the initial build-up. Basically, all your questions remain unanswered in the end.  The very petite Sara Khan looks too small in front of the muscled hero. The hero plays the role of a struggling singer but looks like an aspiring actor from Lokhandwala. Supporting actors try too hard to be funny. Songs sung by Udit Narayan are probably the only good thing about the film.

The latter gets trapped in a rape camp. After losing his parents and entire village to war, a young boy strives hard for his sister's safety. The two hope for a better future. An old man ensures his fellow villagers a safe passage to India. A rebel leader indulges in guerrilla warfare against the Pakistanis to help his countrymen.  While the facts are for all to see, not many have attempted to recount Bangladesh's painful journey to freedom. A war, which lasted for nine months, led to innumerable brutal killings, rape, loss of hope and innocence. Debutant director Mrityunjay Devvrat recreates the tragedy that left many scarred for life.  While the events (some fictionalised) are poignant and tear-evoking, the narrative struggles to hold the film together. The filmmaker's constant desire to shuttle between simultaneously running parallel tracks ends up breaking the flow. While the pace is unhurried throughout, you wonder why the background to the war was so hastily wrapped up in the beginning.  Barring brief video grabs of Indira Gandhi's interview with the BBC explaining India's take on the '71 war, the political scenario stays untouched. A fleeting mention of Mukti Bahini and Yahya Khan is not enough. You crave to know more about the war, its causes, history, strained relations between the countries, etc., but that doesn't happen. Exclusion of the back-story kills the relevance somewhere.  In spite of the odds, COH stands out for its earnest performances and thoughtful music. The film is tense and atmospheric. Wish it was more in-depth as well, given the gravity of the subject.

Larger-than- life superstars, bulging bosoms, sensual sins, high-riding hemlines, charisma galore and exciting extra-marital affairs. This is where 'The X-pose' unfolds. At a glittering after-awards party a top actress, Zara (Sonali), is found dead. \"Murder\" they said. \"Who's the suspect?\" they quizzed. And the music of a rip-roaring era played on.  movie  With a line-up of (usual) suspects - Ravi Kumar (Himesh) playing an angry ex- cop turned South actor (with dialogue-baazi like - \"Main joh bol deta hoon, wohi script ban jaata hai!\"). He's signed up by Bollywood director Subbu Prasad (Ananth) for a film titled 'Ujjwal Nirmal Sheetal' ('Satyam Shivam Sundaram' anybody?), opposite sexy siren Zara, who tries to seduce him out of his puritanical vows.  Ravi, however, is madly in love with newbie Chandni (Zoya), who's being launched in 'Reena Mera Naam'(remember 'Johnny Mera Naam'?) and is Zara's arch rival (cat-fights coming up!). There's also music composer KD (YoYo) - with a Pran-like-latt, who 'rips' rap music, and a host of cagey characters to add intrigue to this conspiracy.  Ananth's motley of filmi characters is colourful, comical and hilariously OTT. With razzmatazz, he interestingly draws references from real incidents and real stars. Himesh's role has a Raaj Kumar hangover; Zoya and Sonali are modelled on Parveen Babi and Zeenat Aman. Irrfan (as narrator) is the black-marketeer who makes big bucks. This whodunit has more tongue-in-cheek humour than suspense, more 'laugh' (with dialogue-baazi) than 'gasp' moments. And peppy music packaged in '60s' style.  It's pacy but the plot unravels stylishly, not intelligently (some suspects don't have a clear motive for murder). Sonali is stunning and impressive, Zoya makes a pretty picture and Yo Yo is best when he's grooving. Himesh slips well into his character, with quirkiness and confidence. This is far from a mind-bending thriller, but a decent effort which has some good 'ol masala to keep you entertained.

An ode to braveheart Manjunath, an IIM Lucknow graduate, the movie intends to carry forward the late whistle-blower's battle against the system.  movie  The biopic is worth applauding as it goes beyond the obvious. It doesn't merely recount crucial events of Manju's life. It tries to analyse what went through his mind before he decided to wage war against corruption and face its gruesome consequences.  By understanding the psyche of the good and the bad guy, we are told, why an idealist doesn't fear death and criminals continue to violate law and order, especially in the northern belt of the country.  What also set the film apart are its heart-rending parent-child moments and heartfelt performances. Renowned artistes Seema Biswas (as Manju's mother) and Kishore Kadam (Manju's father) deserve awards for their tear-evoking acts. Your heart goes out to them for bearing the loss of their honest son. Just the way your mother holds your life together, Biswas holds the film together. Lead actor Sasho Satiiysh Saarathy (as Manjunath) does complete justice to his titular role as well.  However, the film drags in the second half. With the film's running time being a little over two hours, it does test your patience towards the end. A few confrontation scenes get repetitive too. But those flaws can be ignored, given the significance of the subject.  This is one inspirational story, which needs to be watched.

He is the face of the coal mafia. From poor to rich, cops and political leaders to killers, everyone worships him. No one dares to raise their voice against his atrocities, barring IAS officer Nisheeth Kumar (Suniel Shetty). But Saryu's henchman/ killing machine Karua (Vipinno) kidnaps the officer's child, giving rise to more random killings.  movie  Koyelaanchal lacks a proper story. From coal mafia to collector's baby to Karua's change of heart to Maoist movements, you keep wondering what the film is all about! Characters jump in and out of the film randomly. The action scenes are poorly executed and the sound effects are terrible. The intent was to expose the mafia's atrocities but that does not come across at all. Supporting actors ham endlessly and a woman forever displaying her cleavage doesn't salvage the poor script.  Though having a strong presence, both Vinod Khanna and Suniel Shetty are awfully wasted. Vipinno gets the maximum footage and he fails to deliver. Barring a few effective moments (a scene where Suniel Shetty loses his cool over the laidback authorities), nothing manages to evoke a reaction.  Stay away from these coal mines, rather yeh minewa se dur raho!

Must read more intellectually stimulating porn ... Must sex-educate the self through pulp fiction of the sleaziest kind ... Must update self on the birds and the bees... Because life's a b***h and love is a fantasy between (book) covers and because 'Mastram' says it's a 'must'! Yes, Mastram was India's Shakespeare of sleaze, the bard of the bawdy who controlled all the mind-fornication there was, that held all of North India in its 'jerky' grip through the 80s.  movie  Rajaram (Rahul), a M.A in Hindi, quits his bank job in Manali to pursue his dream of being a novelist. He finds support only in his sanskari wife (Tara), and even after desperate attempts, all publishers reject his literary work because his kahanis have the matter but lack the 'meat'. Realizing that sex sells like hot samosas and lust 'whets' hungry minds over literature, the struggling Premchand in him begins churning out porn-packed in-paperbacks, under the pseudonym of 'Mastram'.  His lurid stories ('Baniye Ka Lollipop', 'Sheela Ka Yowan') discreetly called 'woh-wali kitaab' becomes a best-seller. But what happens when the covers are pulled off his identity and he's exposed as the man who sells sexual fantasies for a living?  Jaiswal's premise is different and daring; he bares the hypocrisies of a society that shames, silences and devours sex - all in the same breath (ahh!). Even the typography of the title symbolizes a male organ, but the film is far from pornographic. It's about the psyche and dilemma of a writer torn apart between art and erotica. The problem is the storytelling that's languid and uninventive for a subject so explorative.  The story lacks stamina, and the background music drags the plot. Rahul's performance warms up at the start, but his expressions soon get repetitive, and Tara can't juice the plot that runs dry.  The film that had a lot of potential, but what's missing is the 'woh wali baat'.

Hounded by debt collectors, they decide to sell off their pet goat 'Shahrukh' as the last resort. However, the goat means the world to the little boy in the family. Shahrukh is after all his best friend and constant companion. Helpless and heartbroken, he finds solace in cool city barber Jaffer's (Anshuman Jha) clever solution to his dilemma.  movie  Their idea turns things around for the Qureshis and the goat, who ends up becoming an overnight sensation. But then begins the politics of religion, horrors of blind faith and lust for money.  Janaki Vishwanathan's concept that highlights the little ironies of life and fickleness of human nature is a sure-shot winner. The slice-of-life tale is convincing and thus believable. The village has been beautifully captured on camera and the actors' genuine performances lend authenticity to the setting. Anshuman Jha in particular is impressive. Suruchi Aulakh stands out too but the actress is a tad too theatrical and high-pitched for cinema. Overall, the film works for its quirky premise.  However, while one expects Janaki to make the most of 'Shahrukh' (pun intended), that track holds no relevance to the story at all. Any name could have sufficed. Also, after delving into issues like religion and superstition, the director plays it safe by offering no conclusion or take on either. This dilutes the motive and makes the story seem half-baked.  Editing is a major flaw. A few scenes end abruptly while the rest go on forever, making you wonder if the director forgot to say 'cut'. A slow build-up and a comparatively hurried climax are spoilers too. Even the dialogues are not as funny as they should ideally be.  To sum it up, the film is as unique as superstar Shah Rukh Khan, but it lacks his charisma.

So what if it's not about millions and mansions, chateaus or chartered planes. Their sapna is made of strong stuff too. As kadak as the chai Arjun Harishchandra Waghmare (Partho), serves daily at the tea-stall for meagre wages.  movie  Son of a cotton-farmer, he's uprooted from the village after his baba's shocking death, to the slums of Mumbai. Here, he toils long hours to support his family. One evening he witnesses a skating coach, Lucky (Saqib), eagerly training a group of privileged kids. He's besotted by a pair of shiny roller-skates and thereon, this Dharavi boy is on a dream-roll.  His adorable buddies (poor kids with 'XL'-sized hearts) Gochi, Bhura, Abdul and Murugan share his dream of \"wheel balance ka khel\", making his passion their own. On seeing his talent and tenacity, Lucky finds a new goal - to make Arjun a champ. But will his sapna (riding high on his hand-made, red and gold wheels - called 'Hawaa Hawaai') smoothly make it to the finish line?  Amol Gupte's story is soulful, heart-breaking and hopeful - moving you from tears to deep thought. He skillfully creates a portrait of the lives of deprived children - with profundity and playfulness. The child-like chemistry the kids share is delightful (whether it's bonding over leftover butter chicken or skate-shopping with thirty bucks).  It's often stretched and over-dramatized, yet, the story is so heart-warming that the flaws seem like unnecessary details before a climax (however predictable), that's fulfilling. Gupte's children are pure gems - Partho's brilliance wins you over, backed by the rest of the bachchas who're incredibly talented. Saqib is terrific as a coach with an indefatigable spirit and Neha marvels with a motherly act.  HH's inspiring story is for children, for the child in all of us and for adults who need to wake up to dream again.

When he doesn't indulge in slow-mo fist-fights with the bad guys, he looks after the poor and needy.  movie  Enters 'I am so cute' Sarah (Prachi Sinha), whose character is a cross between Basanti of Sholay and Asin from Ghajini. The talkative girl falls for the brooding hero, who's in no mood for love. He is obsessed with fighting injustice instead. What lies ahead for the two - one driven by relentless love, the other by his troubled past?  An indestructible hero, vengeance, a love story and painful flashbacks...though this film has no direct reference to Bachchan, it clearly looks inspired by his cult classic Agneepath. The newcomers act well, stunts look realistic and the songs do not interrupt the narrative.  However, the film lacks novelty. The story has been done to death and characters aren't established enough for you to feel for them. Stunts are given more prominence but after a while, they look repetitive. Modest production values make the film look like a blander version of its predecessors. Overall, the film lacks intensity. The happenings fail to evoke a reaction and there lies its failure.

Colour it, fade it. Use it, abuse it - but it ain't easy giving up on it. Righto! That's the mantra of this famous five, who've outgrown their chaddi-buddy years (in small-town Kasauli) becoming young men who repeatedly swear by their 'denim decree' (Friends forever! Blah!).  They call themselves the Kasauli Cowboys (Uhh!). Sam (Aditya) is the jaan of the group; he's super-rich, a wannabe rockstar and phoren educated. His best yaar Sid (Tanuj) is simple man of few expressions (literally!). Suzi, Tino and Bobby are the other cowboys who doff their hats to this dosti. Sam (Aditya)lands from London for a summer-break and stirs up Kasauli's sedentary life with wild partying, stiff pegs, pataoing PYT's and Punjabi rock (so what if he's a die-hard Jim Morrison fan!). A starry-eyed snow-white Nayantara (Izabelle) strolls into the woods with a plastic smile (mind you, that's the 'only' lasting expression) adding a new dimension to the story - called a love-triangle (surprise!!!). The best friends are in love with her, one is ready to seduce, the other 'zips it' (for no real reason). Obviously, leading to betrayal of the cowboys' code of conduct. There are more dimensions here (an alcoholic mom - Sarika, single-mom - Rati) with no depth that stretches the story. Soon this purani friendship is bleached dry of all its coolness, colour and chemistry.  movie  Debutante director Bassu's story, mounted on a pretty canvas, with zestful music (Ram Sampath) doesn't quite make the cut because she unabashedly opts for a 'comfort fit' that's so out of style. The plot is 'skinny' with a spattering of cliches. The storytelling is inconsistent (too 'straight'), and the poorly sketched characters with and their below average performances wears you out further. Aditya, shows some spunk and promise, Tanuj tries hard but seems uncomfortable in his skin (blame it on the denims, huh?).  Yes, the concept of dosti symbolized as purani jeans is as old as cowboys in the wild west. But this denim offering leaves you 'blue' and 'uncool'.

If an overdose of poor acting, silly dialogues ('Meri shaanti hamesha ke liye shaant ho gayi'), pointless songs, forced incidents and badly choreographed stunts were not enough, you are forced to see Sanjay Kapoor do the tandav wearing fig leaves (posing as Adam)! He has his secret motives. You give up trying to make sense of the proceedings by then.  movie  The first half drags to death, while the second lacks purpose and defies logic. For instance, which hospital calls its surgical room 'major operation theatre'? Why would a doctor say, 'good good' to a patient's relative after he promises the doc he would arrange money for an operation.  Unfortunately, the film's highlight is its awful animation. These scenes can give Jaani Dushman a run for its money.  Barring Ravindra Jain's soulful music and Jackie Shroff's presence, everything else fails.

Kya Lahore? Kya 'baat'! Yes, battle-banter over cross-border firing and a bombardment of dialogues forms the crux of this film, set at a time (1948) when the border lines between India and Pakistan reeked of fresh blood. In today's context, those very boundaries have dulled, the battle-lines have hardened and the banter has changed. To a more contemporary barrage of dialogues. 'KDKL' deals out languid laughter and a dark humour-in-uniform. Yet, all of it stems from scarred memories and open wounds of partition that've painfully throbbed over generations.  movie  Narrated and presented by maestro writer/lyricist Gulzar, the story unfolds when a Pakistani soldier, Rehmat (Raaz); born in Delhi and now 'displaced' in newly-formed Pakistan, is confronted by an Indian soldier, Samarth (Rishi), who's grown up in Lahore, now migrated to Delhi. The satirical conversations, candour, 'crossness', form a large part of the dialogue between two lost souls. What starts as a spiteful fury of words, punctuated with blood and bullets, warms up into a heart-rending tale. And somewhere, the inbred bhaichara and binding nostalgia ties the two uprooted souls like an undeniable umbilical cord.  Debutant director Vijay Raaz's story stays firmly focused on his two subjects (Rehmat, Samarth), in the same location throughout; with brief inclusion of only two other characters. The plot, (reminiscent of Oscar-winning Bosnian film, 'No Man's Land'), is a rare attempt in Indian cinema. The essence of the story rests in its dialogues (Manu Rishi) - like rich, evocative poetry - which carries the emotional weight of the film. In that also lies the problem, the shuddh Urdu-Punjabi-Hindi is often difficult to grasp amidst raging emotions. Hence, it might not appeal to all. Also, the film feels a tad long. Performances by Raaz and Rishi are brilliant and the background score (Sandesh Shandilya) adds tear-jerking heaviness.  One of the finest things about 'KDKL' is Gulzar's poetic prologue. Without the usual trappings of filmi fanfare, this story has its heart in the right place - pure and undivided. Like pre-partition brotherhood.

And yet, there is an innocence about her that is alluring. We're told that her late father, an army man, is whom she has got her spirited nature from. Of course, her homemaker ma admonishes her and tells her that girls shouldn't behave like goondas. But Kaanchi, who is also called 'Sigdi' (a hot stove) doesn't subscribe to her mom's views. Her lover Binda (Karthik Aaryan) is the local fitness consultant who trains the neighbourhood in combat. Like Kaanchi, he too is obsessed with keeping his town in the hills safe.  movie  Patriotic intentions apart, a lame love story with limp kisses follow. Before Kaanchi and Binda embark on their journey of bliss, the antagonist Sanjeev Kakda (TV hottie, Rishab Sinha), who desperately needs a haircut and acting lessons, comes into the picture. Coming back to the plot, Kakda is infatuated with Kaanchi and when she resists, he recoils.  From here the film descends into a mishmash. Hell hath no fury than a Subhash Ghai heroine scorned. Kaanchi goes from Koshampa to Mumbai to seek revenge. In what is the most childish plot ever, she masquerades as a domestic help in the Kakda household (comprising Rishi, Mithun and bad-hair boy). She conducts a sting operation, throws open a can of worms and blows the cover on this family, who have political leanings and havala earnings. And by the time she's done with her Mother India act, you're too tired to seek reason.  Mishti looks a cross between Rani Mukherjee and Mandakini. Hoardings proclaim she is Kaanchi the unbreakable, but her voice is so shrill, it can cut glass. And Mr Ghai you're the maker of Kaalicharan, Vishwanath, Karz, Hero, Ram Lakhan, Karma, Pardes and Taal. Permit us to just rewind to your past glory.

Not one to offend his intelligence, he only takes up cases that are challenging enough.  A deserted haveli in Shimla gives Samrat what he's looking for - a daunting task to battle a villain, who may or may not have supernatural powers. As threats turn into grisly murders, Samrat connects the dots to realise there's more to the puzzle than meets the eye.  movie  The film is predominantly a formulaic 'whodunit' thriller, which aspires to be Sherlock Holmes but ends up looking like its parody. This too opens with a bare-knuckle, slow-mo boxing scene like Guy Ritchie's film (starring Robert Downey Jr.), but thereafter, fails to instill a sense of fear or anxiety, thanks to the excessive dialogue.  Samrat's sidekick CD (Gopal Datt as Chakradhar aka Watson) annoys with his compulsive talking, while Samrat over-explains his deductions. Also, the film seems overlong as it crawls towards an elongated, predictable climax. Barring Rajeev Khandelwal, everyone else is loud. The script lacks punch as the 'Samratisms' (one-liners) are anything but clever. To top it all, an animated Shimla evokes maximum laughter.  While it's brave of the conservative Rajshri productions to take the leap - from family dramas to thrillers, the effort should have been more compelling. While Sherlock Holmes was dismissive of mediocrity, Samrat succumbs to it.

Such is the firepower of one crackerjack of a woman who preens like a desi diva (in metallic conical bras), cusses like a true-bred Chambal-ki-Rani, and fires more barood in the bistar than her toy-boy can handle.  Surely, no daaku clan can boast of such a fierce phashionista (dons designer wear from 'Benice'), quite unattractive and scarred, yet,deliciously deadly. Alka Singh aka Revolver Rani (Kangna) is a dacoit-turned-politician who's lost her seat to the opposition in Gwalior, resulting in bloody bullet baths. Her toy-boy Rohan (Vir), a struggling Bollywood actor, becomes her full-time obsession. He wants to use her as a step to stardom; instead, he becomes her sex-machine. Hereon, the story tragically turns into an ironic mix of politics, comedy and a love story with bleeding wounds.  movie  Sai Kabir's skill lies in his satirical story-telling and style, not so much the plot. The crux is simple - power, politics and revenge. It's a combo of cool and crass - the kind of stuff pulp fiction is made of. Often textured in Quentin Tarantino style, he sets the mood with a notorious mix of quirkiness, violence and an eclectic background score. The second half is stretched, the songs interrupting the pace. Some dark, humorous moments (even the background score) are quite inspired by 'Kill Bill'.  Kangna is pure dynamite, firing on all barrels. With a tanned tone, kohl eyes and mercurial moods - she uses every weapon to fire a mind-blowing performance. Vir strikes at times but his character is not as fleshed out; Piyush (as Alka's *mama*) is superb and Zakir adds power to the plot.  'Revolver Rani' is loaded with a lot more than just gunpower. You'll enjoy biting this bullet.

Here's how the tamasha unfolds. A taangewala (he's Hamid for Muslims and Kishen for Hindus) is killed when a life-sized cut-out of a neta accidentally falls on him. Suddenly, from an ignominious nobody he turns into a sought-after dead body. The Hindus insist he should be cremated, the Muslims want him buried. Court demands proof of birth, death, marriage, even circumcision. Alas, there's none!  movie  Slogans like \"Nahin bangle, nahin gaadi, humko de do Kishan ki body\", hilariously heighten the fanaticism amidst aam junta. There's also an opportunistic heavyweight newspaper publisher Mutthaseth (Kaushik), the Editor, Kulkarni, burying the real stories (and his journalism ethics) for shallow sensation and a parody of other curious characters in this satirical dramedy.  From the director of the National Award winner 'Gandhi, My Father' and highly acclaimed play 'Tumhari Amrita', 'DTD' is disturbing, thought-provoking and humorously tragic. It deals with our society's paradoxical concepts of religious identity and humanity. It dramatically reflects our nation's mindless beliefs in political propaganda without a perspective and media's often misplaced priorities. There are intelligently written scenes (courtroom debate), some brilliant dialogues and good performances (Kaushik, Azmi, Yadav).  However, the film often rolls out like a play or a social commentary with staged events (often over-stretched) that result in an abrupt narrative. The stark portrayal of bare-faced reality (devoid of background music) with a cast of commoners - gives it a docu-drama flavour. 'DTD' is 'grave' alright, but offers hilarity in decent doses.  This one is a postmortem on all the corpses that haunt the common man. And we don't have to dig too deep for that, do we?  "},{"Name":"2 States","Release Time":"Apr 25 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Arjun Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Amrita Singh, Revathi, Ronit Roy","Director":"Abhishek Varman","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours 29 minutes","Review":" For an audience that has been around from the '80s, debutant Abhishek Varman's '2 States' may seem like they are revisiting K Balachander's mega hit 'Ek Duuje Ke Liye' (1981), where the Tamil boy had to cross endless hurdles to patao the Punjabi girl. However, that movie had too much angst and a tragic end.  movie  2 States is a happy film (with measured anguish). Romance in cross-cultural or even cross-border situations isn't new to Bollywood. What makes 2 States work is the simple narrative told humorously. Adapted as it is, from one of author Chetan Bhagat's best-selling works, the film, just like the book before it, is light-hearted. Chetan's funny one-liners and life-view are studiously borrowed by the director for his screen outing. And though there is a sense of deja-vu, for those who have read the book, the movie still manages to charm and surprise.  Krish Malhotra (Arjun) and Ananya Swaminathan(Alia) meet on the IIM Ahmedabad campus. Sparks fly between economic coaching and food poaching. Their tender love, compulsive copulation and kissing chemistry (adeptly portrayed by the young screen lovers) make this couple reason that they could spend a lifetime together. But in India, where tradition and parents are nurtured, couples have to literally marry each other's families.  Incidentally, for those in an inter-caste marriage, this movie could resonate like your own tale. The playful digs at each other's cultures, the self-deprecating remarks about one's family and community are all laugh-out-loud moments. Amrita-Ronit, Revathi-Shiv Subramaniam infuse life into their roles of the Punjabi and Tamil parents. The spitfire Alia and a sober Arjun are also lovable. If you are in a mood for a Bollywood family saga with measured melodrama and the right amount of naach-gaana, visit 2 States.

'Who's there?\" 'BOO!' 'Boo, who?' Don't wet your chads, kiddos. It's just 'Ghostbuster' time with a 70-year old bhoot - mushy as marshmallow - gearing up to play 'peek-a-BOO' once again.  movie  After his last visit to earth (prequel), Bhoothnath (Bachchan) goes back to exotic Bhoothworld, where ghosts lavishly live it up. Though it's run like a sarkari organization with departments like 'Reincarnation Section', 'Bhooth Mail', et al. Lol!. 'BN' is ridiculed by his gang-of-ghosts at his inability at scaring kids. While there's a long wait for reincarnation (longer if you want to be reborn as Aamir's dog. Bhoots love Bollywood too!), 'BN' gets one final chance to descend to earth for another kiddie scarefest. There he meets the zesty, tapori slumboy, Akhrot (Parth) who's the only one who can see ghosts. They form an inseparable team of ghostbusters - evicting haunting bhooths from buildings, and other earthly endeavours (like cleaning up garbage on the streets and inside the system).  Soon they meet the conniving politician Bhau (Boman), and after some awakening 'BN' agrees to contest elections as the first ever bhooth candidate. He turns into a celebrity ghost, posing for media interviews, and teaming up with filmys. But will Bhoothnath's ghostly powers be able to match up to the ghastly politics of humans?  Tiwari's sequel sets off with a lot of promise, entertainment, laughs and endearing camaraderie between a bhooth and a boy. The first-half has wittily written scenes - strung with satire and emotion, but the story slowly turns into a tedious vocational course on voting. The preaching distracts from some superb performances and inadvertently loses humour, but the story does have its heart in the right place. 'BN' makes a comeback at a perfect time - bang on with our Indian elections, and packs a powerful message, albeit with potholes in the plot.  Bachchan is brilliant as the bhooth having a ball at his bhootiyapa, but his booming spiels are sometimes banal; it's the one-liners that score. Boman is 'predictably' good but OTT in parts; and Mishra (lawyer) enthuses with an effortless act. The leader of this party is unquestionably child artist Parth. His confidence, charm and energy are incredible. He has the best lines in the film, adding as much gusto (if not more) to this ghost-story.  So, you better go to the polling b(h)ooth on election day, because Bhoothnath says so! Or risk being 'haunted' by bad governance.

This just swaps the roles of humans and aliens. Here, the aliens want earth's gravity, which is why they intend to conquer it, endangering the human species in the process. The superstitious humans on the contrary consider them to be 'gods' as they miraculously cure people.  Three friends (Omkar Das Manikpuri, Dev Gohar, Satyendra Khare), who spot the aliens first on their drunken escapades, have their own issues to deal with. The company of these extra-terrestrials gives them a sense of importance in their village and society at large, but little do they know about their intention. What happens and who survives?  The film attempts to address social issues as well as entertain but bad make-up and mediocre special effect spoils the fun. The treatment is too archaic. While Hollywood swears by science fiction and fantasy, Hindi films rarely dabble in this genre. It's fairly understandable, given our lack of expertise in it. Even if we do attempt making one, the results haven't been too pleasing, as the plot is mostly borrowed from American films which are in a different league altogether. Thus, except for the commercially viable Krrish franchise and Rajinikanth starrer Robot, Hindi sci-fi hasn't been too promising.  Besides, execution matters the most for films like these. Big budget projects still manage to draw massive audiences, given the star power and effective special effects. But can a film made with a decent plot but poorproduction values make the cut?  Ebn-E-Batuta works as a comedy with its intentional and unintentional humour but as sci-fi, it fails to deliver.

However, even more than Junior, MTH has his dad David Dhawan stamped all over it. Hence, eternally smiling Seenu (Varun) is unfazed by failure or goons. Seenu pauses from cheeky grinning only to dance and romance, falling for Sunaina (Ileana), stalked by violent Angad (Arunoday) and sidekick Peter (Rajpal). More superhero than hero, Seenu shows Angad his mean fight moves, but finds himself captured by ardent Ayesha (Nargis), whose 'Dadduz' Vikrant (Kher) is the biggest don of Asia and Africa too! How can Seenu get out of so many clutches?  movie  This being a David Dhawan movie, things get complicated but never grim. Thus, MTH's mafia dons are portly, chuckling men, the hero expresses love by asking, \"Do you want to make the frandship with me?\", Ayesha makes Seenu recall Basanti pawed by Veeru, and that lovely 1990s' filmi word - \"Unkil!\" - resounds once again. Seenu even does a brilliant bhajan take-off on Budtameez Dil. The plot is familiar Dhawan territory - one boy, two babes, a mansion and many clowns - but with new landmarks, from plunging bikinis to lip-glossed kisses, thrown in.  Varun meshes Govinda, Michael Jackson and his own madness well. He gets better in a stronger second half, bolstered by gorgeous Nargis pouting, \"Thenk you, Dadduz!\" and the banter between Kher and snarling subordinate Bally (Shukla). Arunodaya surprises - the actor's evolved, pulling off threats and blushes to comic effect. Those seeking movies with meaning, note - Main Tera Hero is a pav bhaji picture, quick, spicy, hot. It has the depth of a comic strip but it also has its neon-shaded fun. For those who want a light laugh, here's your boy.

Beyond that, daddy dearest has no time for sonny boy. Surprisingly, he doesn't even seem to notice his child's continuously smacked cheeks. And in what is ridiculous and retarded, the father, who is constantly talking into a phone at the dinner table, notices a gun on his son, many moons after Viki has begun spending time with a local hoodlum Tony Mota (Prashant Narayan).  movie  The goon grooms the boy to be \"his bullet\" to be used when the time is right.

Please note, none of the mafia dons instill fear, nor do they endear. They just talk, shoot and then talk some more, lulling you into sleep. For an action thriller, the narrative pace is so languid, you can take your popcorn and pee break between the times when two bullets are fired.  Lakwa (Sunny Deol) with a ridiculous North-Indian accent, sporting an unibrow and facial fuzz shows up in a wasted special appearance.

You don't play this game. It plays you. A few assassins, working for a common mafia-drug lord, are tricked into taking up a dangerous deal that unfolds a murder mystery. Can they predict who's calling the shots?  If you are a fan of film noir and a nonlinear narrative, Station will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is dark, gritty throughout as well as nerve-shatteringly tense in portions, especially towards the end. The complex plot falls into place like a jigsaw puzzle. The intention was to make a dark psychological thriller and the execution justifies the thought. The first-time actors are surprisingly natural on camera. The background score adds to the film's eeriness.  What heightens your anticipation is how the characters keep double-crossing each other. The build-up is intense, resulting in the climax being the highlight of the film and the 'waiting room' sequence does deliver. However, it is not for the faint-hearted as the 'fear of the unknown' engulfs you.  But what spoils the fun is the director's overindulgence in the scene. You lose your patience as it's stretched for no reason. Also, in order to achieve 'unpredictability', the plot gets way too convoluted eventually.  Given the genre, the length and the pace are major issues. The film could have been way shorter as it drags in the second half. Also how can you not shoot a film on organised crime in Mumbai! It's a major drawback. Makeup and outfits are too casual and refined to suit the setting.  Ideally, this concept could have worked better for a short film or a play. Nonetheless, watch it for the nonlinear narrative.

Their wish is fulfilled when corrupt politician Khwaja (Kher) hooks up with noodle-strapped, fuchsia-lipped media manager Sherry (Bedi) to handle corrupt allocations of contracts in Delhi's Asian Olympic Games. As a CBI investigator Tripathi gets murdered and Khwaja's political rival Kilol (Raaz) wants him exposed, the two reporters find themselves caught in serious cross-fire.  movie  O Teri's story picks up recent corruption scandals, mashing these with classic cinematic takes on scams.

Given these elements, O Teri could have been bitingly hilarious, but it isn't. The overburdened story unravels under a palpable nervousness to please all.

Governed by a 28-year Prime Minister, well-bred, free-thinking and fashionably good-looking in denims and designer wear. And a live-in hottie girlfriend as the First Lady. Howzaat? Read on.  Abhimanyu Kaul's (Jackky) funky life of gaming, wild partying and romancing lady-love, Anwita (Neha), while living-in with her in Tokyo, comes to a shocking halt. His father (Boman), the powerful PM of India suddenly passes away, entrusting Abhi with the coveted seat to serve the nation. He can no longer live like an aam aadmi.  movie  Overnight, his life is stripped off all normalcy and privacy. Tailor-made sherwanis, kurtas make way into his wardrobe, and a pack of men-in-black (read commandos) make way into his bedroom. 'Parties' have a whole new meaning and night-life means nashta with nefarious netas. Dinner dates with his gal is definitely more than a twosome, and his new circle boasts of political giants (so what if his buddies disappear from his hacked Facebook account! Sigh!).  His only trust-worthy man is Akbar uncle (Shaikh), the PA to the PM. His politically inappropriate personal life comes under scanner of the junta and media, but the couple refuses to budge from their love-nest to appease the politicos. Abhi is a master in the game of love, but will this Romeo be able to win the game of rajneeti too?  Afzal's 'Youngistaan' at the core is an interesting idea, far-fetched, but refreshing. The love-story develops tenderly, but the political backdrop and ensuing drama is not crafted with clarity. The story suffers from uninspiring dialogues, with a stretched climax. It's a well-intentioned drama which vibes with the current political scenario and upcoming elections (\"mujhe vote dijeye ya na dijeye, lekin vote zaroor dijeya. Ek aapka haq hai.\" Got it?)  Jackky shows sincerity and confidence, with a steady act in a tough role. Neha plays the pretty, exuberant girl-friend with flair. And finally, the superlative - Farooq Shaikh, enacting the last screen role of his life. As always, using his warmth and acting prowess to deliver a great performance (in spite of a poorly sketched role). The young generation will truly miss this performer par excellence.

So as such, the plot that comments on how land-grabbing sharks in cities like Mumbai have torn down beautiful bungalows and breathing spaces to accommodate ugly malls and modern monstrosities is convincing.  The narrative in-film style is entertaining, told as it is by a budding scriptwriter (Sharman Joshi, always good) to an aspiring filmmaker (Parambrata Chatterjee, fresh). The ghosts — Anupam Kher, Jackie Shroff, Rajpal Yadav, Mahie Gill, Meera Chopra, Asrani and Saurabh Shukla -- have some endearing (often irritating) character traits.  movie  Yet, the ghosts' attempts to mess with one another and even their need to serenade the alcoholic actress (Mahie) feels funny initially. If you're feeling indulgent, you may even guffaw at filmi references to Ragini (MMS), Ram Gopal Varma and Makarand (pronounced Maa ka rand). But the jokes get too sidey and the jest is short-lived. In fact, when proceedings are interrupted with an unspirited item song by the dusky Paoli Dam, in a hotspot called Bhoot Bar, where only ghosts are invited, you want to shoot some more people dead.  Post-interval, the real plot of a tycoon (Rajesh Khattar) who has acquired the disputed property with the intention of turning it into a mall is introduced. And the ghosts vow to seek revenge. But their hare-brained plan to bring the tycoon down to his knees is so amateur, that it fails to amuse.  Clearly, makers like Kaushik, who had a formidable box office record in the '90s remaking South Indian films, need to borrow modern-day technique and storytelling tactics to keep the ever-evolving viewer engaged. In the case of GOG, the only ones who seem to have had a blast are the actors - Mahie, Anupam, Saurabh and Jackie, all of who ham.

Day in, day out, you try hard to fit in. Who would want to come across as ignorant, odd and a prude to the judgmental lot after all? It's easier to agree with the majority, hold our heads high and ego higher. In order to safeguard this pretence, we lose out on discovering who we really are. Right from our childhood, we are trained to follow what's been told to us. No questions asked, no risks taken.  The film's protagonist Bauji (Sanjay Mishra) faces this dilemma. Trapped by the burden of duties and responsibilities forever, an incident in his daughter's life directs him to a path of self-discovery and forces him to only believe in what he sees. But can you sustain these idealistic visions in the real world without being tagged either 'crazy' or 'saintly'?  Rajat Kapoor's film is thought-provoking and as a storyteller, he touches a chord. His satirical take on how everyone conforms to the herd mentality is relevant and praise-worthy. It inspires us to unlock the shackles of mediocrity and standard behaviour - comprising of what's right and wrong, true or false.  What we liked the most about this film is its old Delhi setting. It is as authentic as it can get and contributes immensely to the film's emotional quotient. The intricacies of a joint family have been explored beautifully. In fact, this track works better than the one revolving around Bauji's spiritual epiphany. Sadly, the latter gets more prominence.  The performances are another asset. Sanjay Mishra and Seema Bhargava (as Bauji's wife) are flawless. They infuse life into the story. The younger actors are impressive too and thankfully, not a single character's loud and Bollywoodised Punjabi, unlike many Delhi-oriented films.  What however doesn't work for the film is the fact that it borders on abstract at regular intervals and lacks continuity, making a few scenes and conversations seem out-of-context.  Nonetheless, the film is emotionally liberating. See it to believe it.

Pretty and virgin. Comes with a price tag (negotiable). Ready for sale! This is what a brothel-broker's sale-pitch would've been for teenage girl Laskhmi (Monali). A good bargain for a piece of puberty (sic!). Lakshmi's story of tragedy, trauma and triumph begins here.  An obnoxious pimp Chinna (Nagesh) buys off Lakshmi from a village in Andhra Pradesh and packs her off to a brothel (owned by his own corrupt brother, Reddy - Satish Kaushik) called Dharam Vilas Girls Hostel - a sham set up to run his sex trade. Soon she's thrown into a dark world of sex-hungry men who're ready to pay premium for her puberty. The 'madame' of the brothel (Shefali) trains her for the job (with padded bras and jellies to 'slip it in') while her roommate (Flora) teaches her how to allure the sleazeballs. She forges a friendship, but unable to suffer the atrocities, Lakshmi tries to escape the sex slavery. It leads to more unbearable brutality, but she's a fighter. She drags her oppressors to the courtroom and exposes their despicable crimes.  movie  Kukunoor's 'Lakshmi', based on a harrowing true story, is a thought-provoking, disturbing film told with heartbreaking detail and a narrative that is so raw and ruthlessly realistic, it often becomes repulsive.

It is a film that is split into many parts, or chapters, like a book or a play. Each part examines the story from a different angle.  Sheila is married to a successful husband Vikram (Sharma) and spends a lot of time examining how to reconcile her role as a wife who is living in the safe cocoon of an upper-class existence but reflects on her own ambitions and individuality. Sheila has a near-constant stream-of consciousness chatter going on. And one day, Maya appears.  She could very well be a real life person or simply a figment of Sheila's overactive imagination. While Sheila is overly-emotional and definitely lonely in her own world, Maya fashions herself to be the colourfully-dressed provider of pragmatic answers to Sheila's many questions. Maya offers useful but boringly obvious advice about not letting people walk over you and about reinventing oneself; what is ironic is that such bits of wisdom can be applicable to anyone, regardless of gender.  The various chapters of this film aren't in chronological order. Different aspects of Sheila's life appear randomly. This is one of the things that disturb the flow of the film. For example, the pauses between sentences (Maya's in particular) might be aimed at dramatic effect and work in real life, but these make the film drag. While Maya is meant as a counterpoint to Sheila, the former's theatrics and gesticulations are quite over-the-top.  The concept of this film is sound as is Chatterjee's performance but the others are lacking. Under the broad umbrella of Sandcastle's overall feminist import and the examination of aspects related to the female psyche, it is a film about self-realization and identity, but one that could have been told better.

A few days before the event, like most city-bred youngsters, the girls let their hair down and dance the night away at a club.  They catch the eye of a few masked men, who then kidnap the girls and brutally rape them in order to punish their liberal sensibilities. They justify the act by blaming it on their provocative dressing. 'It's social work' reasons bhaiji (Raaj Singh Arora) the mastermind behind the gang rape.  Bruised, battered and raped, the girls are left to die on a highway when a noble truck driver helps them. In spite of the humiliation and pain, the girls decide to fight back. Do they manage to seek revenge?  The filmmaker chooses a sensitive, hard-hitting issue like rape, but barring the rape scenes and explicit dialogues, fails to get the gravity of the situation right. While the actors act well, poor writing makes their characters look juvenile. In spite of knowing the rapist is not westernised, one of the girls appreciates his 'good looks' and explains to him in English, how she wouldn't have minded going out with him willingly, had he sought her 'permission'.  There is no emotional conflict in the story that provokes you to think or get inspired. Situations are written to convenience the protagonists' quest for revenge. And they get it way too easy. The shallow treatment doesn't live up to the topic addressed.

When currency crash leads to heartbreaks and house-breaks. And the youth are left with bankrupt dreams. Morbid, huh? Hold on ... this one is far from a depressive rich-girl, poor-boy plot; instead, 'Bewakoofiyan' is a light-hearted story of how an out-of-work lover-boy signs on for a full-time job of making his love-life work.  Mohit (Ayushmann), a successful senior airline marketing executive, is madly in love with a hip banker, designer damsel, Mayera (Sonam). To burst the bubble in this 'all things good-looking' love story, enter - sullen-faced VK Sehgal (Rishi), Mayera's deadly dad (retired IAS officer who could never make big bucks). He ruthlessly rejects Mohit as the \"bloody fatichar\" who can't afford his darlin' shopaholic daughter's haute fashionable fantasies.

In fact, it crosses over to Brit-land, where butter chicken and bhangra rule the angrezis. And where Singhs are Kings. Here lies the love story of an Indian girl Asha (Yami) and a Pakistani boy Aman (Ali) who're much in love, but confused about how to cross over to the other side.  Well, one has to brave it, so Aman walks into a battlefield of boisterous Punjabi in-laws-to-be. Meet the high-pitched, melodramatic mom-in-law (Kirron) who's convinced \"Yeh shaadi kabhi working nahin karega!\". She tries hard to like her 'damn-aad' (son-in-law-to-be), but his buffoonery leaves her hysterical. Jiah (Sara Khan) is the feisty sis-in-law who breaks into sexy table-top dances and her 5-year-old daughter amusingly plays 'pregnancy' games. Adding to the mayhem is ex-army, senile dadaji (who took shots at Pakis in a real war) and an eccentric anti-Pakistani bro-in-law.  movie  Much later, pa-in-law (Anupam) appears after his night-out with a Brit hooker, causing more chaos in the madhouse. Evidently, there is no hope for peace in this Indo-Pak love war. One crazy act leads to the other, until comedy crosses over to insanity.  E. Niwas' story (adaptation of Spanish rom-com 'Seres Queridos') shows flashes of madness peppered with some 'LOL' dialogues, but the screenplay (Neeraj Pandey) is insipid and loses its comedy metre too often to entertain throughout.

The film's central protagonist is rural Rajjo (Madhuri), who runs an academy where women wield weapons and weave pink saris. Rajjo's Gulaab Gang takes on oppressive elements - dowry-demanding husbands, bribe-demanding babus, grain-hoarding traders, the rapist son of the local neta. The gang, led by Rajjo's merry women including Mahi (Jagdale) and Kajri (Chatterjee), succeeds by winning hearts or breaking bones. But does Rajjo meet her match in unforgiving Madam ji?  Gulaab Gang captures the deep oppression the vulnerable face. Some moments - Rajjo's face falling when Madam ji, presented with a rape charge against neta Pavanji's lout son, responds, \"Aaj kal balatkaar ka kya rate hai?\" - are memorable. The action is crackling and Madhuri looks great, going from dhak-dhak to thak-thak with a big stick. Alongside, Juhi shines with malicious pleasure as Sumitra Madam ji whose ambition - to become raja from patrani - is ferocious. Chawla makes you cringe as she wreaks revenge on anyone who crosses her, the actor getting into her role with lip-licking gusto.  movie  But the dramatic tension simply doesn't hold. Every time there's a face-off between Rajjo and Madam ji, a diversion - a song, a character cracking a joke, guns fired - occurs, breaking the build-up. There are too many tangents, navels and nose-rings, diverting focus from Rajjo, the story's driving force. Instead of knowing how and why she becomes the tigress of Madhavpur, we're given mellifluous songs, intercut with soon-repetitive scenes of exploitation. Considering the subject's intense power and the charisma of these stars, the movie's hesitation with how to proceed stands out. At one point, Rajjo asks a woman, \"Soch soch ke kaahi maarte ho?\" That goes for Gulaab Gang too.

The father is a mithaiwala; his daughter Rani Mehra or Queen (Kangana Ranaut) is naive, even appears stupid in today's context, a virgin, waiting to get married. Destiny has other designs for her. Que sera sera, without divulging too much, you can safely cut to her taking off to Paris, all alone.  The start of Queen's journey bears resemblance to that of Sridevi's in 'English Vinglish'. This Delhi girl is as nervous on her flight to Europe as that Pune housewife was when she was flying to America. Their dumbstruck expressions on the flight and on discovering the magic of their foreign destination, their Indian attire, the dilemmas of what to eat and whom to speak with seem identical. However, that's just a brief resemblance. Otherwise Rani's journey of self-discovery charts its own course.  movie  In Paris, Rani meets the long-legged, dusky Indo-French girl Vijaylakshmi (Lisa Haydon) who befriends her, giving her lessons on love, lust and life. Slowly, Queen's low self-esteem gives way to supreme confidence. Before you know it, she's on a train to the sex capital of the world. At a hostel in Amsterdam, Rani shares a room with three men. And this motley group goes on to forge a bond. Soon, you are as engrossed in their friendship as she is.  Kangana Ranaut's performance is outstanding. Whether she's crestfallen or ecstatic, selling golgappas or naively buying sex-toys, hiding her infatuation for an Italian restaurateur or showing deep dejection about her wimpy beau Vijya (Rajkummar Rao), she's a class act.  Lisa Haydon and Rajkummar Rao lend good support. But this film belongs to its director Vikas Bahl. This is his first solo outing. Earlier he co-directed the National-Award winning 'Chillar Party' with Nitesh Tiwari. Bollywood should blow bugles in his honour.

If not, you will wonder why anyone would bring such an outdated concept to celluloid in this day and age! Forget the gender; anyone who fails to stand for themselves is least appealing, especially if they happen to be the protagonists.  Playing the victim is the film's lead character Anuradha (Disha Choudhary), who is the ideal daughter, wife and sister. Of course, there is no place for good people in society, which is why Anuradha will have to suffer. Her righteousness and compassion worsen her struggle.  She gets bullied by a typical conniving mother-in-law, who demands dowry and tortures Anuradha physically and psychologically if her demands are not met. Anuradha's sister-in-law (Hrishita Bhatt) is a woman of loose morals and another reason for her suffering.  You don't identify or sympathise with the lead character or her dilemmas and there lies the film's failure. In spite of watching her weep throughout, you don't feel for her. The situations look forced and uncalled for. The film may have worked had it been a soap opera but otherwise, it's painful to sit through this archaic tale of endless misery.

But shoddy execution, poor performances and immature storytelling make it look too tacky for you to analyze the topic presented. The film borrows a lot from Page 3, be it socialite-bashing, Bollywood strugglers agreeing to compromise to get that big break or models doubling up as escorts. We have seen all of that before and handled in a much better way.  Here, almost everything gets overshadowed by skimpily clad women who are forever willing to sleep around and are proud enough to acknowledge it. Shaming the immoral ladies and gents is ACP Dhoble (Arif Zakaria), who goes on lecturing the miscreants every time he raids their parties.  Shalini Dixit (Mahi Khanduri), a small town girl, shifts to Mumbai and gets sucked into the DEE - 'Dirty English Entertainment' - culture of rich Mumbaikars (which explains the title). Can the good girl retain her 'middle class' values?  From drugs, betrayal, PDA, casual sex, adultery and dance bars to mafia, crime against women, cops and true love, the film free-floats. It lacks a definite purpose and this ruins everything. The casting and low production value add to the film's misery for the rich don't look 'high-class' to begin with.  Prashant Narayanan does a decent job as a henchman of a Dubai-based don but his role is inconsequential and so is the film.

While one doesn't expect much of a novelty in terms of story when it comes to horror, cliched execution cannot be forgiven. For starters, the film offers standard scary occurrences like doors opening by themselves, drawers banging and children crying used as background score.  movie  None of these 'tried-and-tested' methods manage to shock you, barring a chilling ice skating scene. Also, the plot is extremely predictable. Since you can tell how it's going to end, the big suspense annoys more and thrills less. The languid pace doesn't help either. Extensive use of found-footage style cinematography is not easy on the eyes.  Besides, a few deviations in the story are uncalled for. A side-track comprises of a bunch of bickering rich kids, out to party at the nightclub in the mall. Why would anyone party in that deserted mall in the first place? A guy making out with a firang item girl (who roughly resembles Yana Gupta) has been strictly added to titillate the frontbenchers.  Jimmy Sheirgill's acting prowess is vastly underrated. In spite of being a good actor, he ends up playing second fiddle. The damsel in distress (Nushrat Bharucha) ends up getting more footage. Jimmy's torch-wielding role doesn't require him to do much except for using the flashlight to locate evil spirits. This hide-and-seek gets boring after a while as the buildup itself runs out of steam. Never mind the climax.  The film might work for those who get frightened easily. For fans of the genre, watch Ragini MMS instead, if you still haven't.

It is Imtiaz Ali's starkest, darkest work yet. Rich Veera (Bhatt) steps away from her Monsoon Wedding-style shaadi preparations (a handheld camera capturing gold, ghaghras and a girl going, \"Bhaiyya, flavvers lappet do!\") for a break with her reluctant fiance. Driving into a foggy Delhi night, Veera steps out to breathe free - and gets kidnapped by violent criminal Mahavir Bhaati (Hooda) and his gang. Gagged, tied-up, slapped and starved, Veera's thrown onto a terrifying truck that drives off on a never-ending highway, leaving established society far behind. What does Veera experience on this trip?  movie  Highway belongs unabashedly to Alia Bhatt. Her Veera is stunning - sincere and simple, prettily earnest, shakily emotional. Bhatt's range and prowess are evident in her timid confidence, the slow swagger Veera gains as she takes control of the situation, captivating her captor, confronting assault. Hooda's Mahavir is frightening, tightly controlled, the actor conveying dark dislike with crackling tension, switching to bewilderment with comic ease. Alongside, Aaroo (Durgesh Kumar), Mahavir's companion, who breaks into a delightful trance-wala dance with Veera as she sways to 'English music' on the road, is memorable.  But what stamps this film indelibly is its sheer boldness. Imtiaz Ali must be congratulated for his daring novelty, for a powerful heroine-centric story, for his heroine who looks like a Vermeer painting dressed in a dusty ghaghra. At times, Highway feels like an unending Bharat darshan, a long look at suffering souls through several deserts and eucalyptus trees. But some meandering is its only flaw. Watch it for its cathartic creativity, for colours akin to Iranian palettes, for sound design where melting qawwalis, chirruping crickets and a screeching train make layers of noise - for that shot where Veera rests her head on a pillow of water.  Highway is not an easy ride. But it offers fresh breezes and new sights.

Gunday is Oliver Twist, given a Bollywood twist. Orphaned Bala (Kapoor) saves waif Bikram (Singh) from a paedophile in war-torn Bangladesh. Escaping officials, the two boys reach Calcutta, hiding on a train. Facing homelessness and heartlessness, the duo decides to conquer life, selling stolen coal - till they become Calcutta's most famous gundey, controlling all its illegal trading from timber to fish. Bikram and Bala are tough, cheerful and inseparable - until they both fall for cabaret dancer Nandita (Chopra). As they bitterly fall out with each other, ACP Satyajit Sarkar (Khan) closes in for the kill.  movie  Gunday showcases refugee Robin Hoods refusing to be beaten. Its music has peppy, bright dil while its muscular action is hard-hitting. Irrfan stands out as the sarcastically drawling cop while Arjun displays endearing vulnerability as dark-natured Bala. Ranveer endows Bikram with a charming, if familiar swagger while Priyanka infuses Nandita with languid sexiness. However, the plot distractedly rushes in several directions - refugee angst, ration cards, the system's rot, gang wars, bromance, romance, broken bromance - while Calcutta appears like a Wild West of the east, fringed by Chambal-like landscapes through which goods trains sway, gundas bashing each other to coal dust atop. Gunday's heart is in the right place but the plot gets overwhelmed by its own voluptuousness, its slick torsos and slow-motion slaps, its extended Durga Puja which leaves it lost between Calcutta's cabarets and Dhanbad's dark mines.  However, Gunday's fun while it lasts. Bala and Bikram's chemistry is literally fleshed out well - don't miss the cheeky salaam to Salman Khan when their shirts fly off - and you giggle as they're scolded, \"Daant mat dikhao!\" More depth, more fire would've sharpened this film. But Gunday offers glitter coating a grim tale.

For his own vested interest, he incites violence by convincing the fickle-minded youngsters into believing that they must kill in order to safeguard Islam.  Fighting Jilani's beliefs is another staunch Muslim with a conflicting ideology - the righteous Dr Mazhar (Manzar Sehbai). He dares to expose the maulana and propagates the teachings of Islam. ATS officer Ranvijay Singh (Ajaz Khan) helps Dr Mazhar in countering terrorism in the name of jihad. Can they foil Jilani's vicious terrorist plot and save the young couple Imran (Vikram Singh) and Amreen (Arjumman Mughal), who also get embroiled in the deadly situation?  Ya Rab is an honest attempt to debar stereotypes and the image of Islam based on false notions, reiterating that no religion expects you to harm others, let alone take innocent lives. However, we have seen films raising this issue in a more mature way before.  It may have started out as a noble intention, but the film's execution is outdated and comes across as cliched. You have deafening music every time the villain makes an appearance and he (Akhilendra Mishra) screams at the top of his lungs to look evil. Newcomer Arjumman Mughal acts well. Ajaz Khan has a good screen presence, but exudes a rough demeanour, that's more akin to a crook. The dialogues are way too dramatic, instead of hard-hitting. The linear storyline and overtly simplistic narrative may appeal to those who prefer the formulaic cinema of the 80s. Thus, the film might find appeal in mass audiences, which explains its style.

The film, nicely adapted and understated (except for the misplaced title track) deals with the disturbingly real phenomenon of anesthetic awareness in which surgery patients, though paralyzed are conscious of everything they are experiencing including pain. It's an absorbing thriller. And one doffs one's hat to Shekhar for handling this difficult subject with such finesse.  The protagonist Aditya (Adhyayan Suman) is molly-coddled and stifled by his rich mother Gayatri (Deepti Naval). He also has a life-threatening heart ailment and needs a transplant. His mother's silent admirer Dr Trehaan (Om Puri) is the ideal choice of medic. However, Adi seeks out his friend, a lesser known surgeon Sameer (Shekhar Suman) and entrusts him with his life.  movie  Richie Rich also finds himself drawn to Ria (Ariana Ayam), a receptionist at a Dubai hotel. Their love blossoms after two songs and a tour of Dubai. She follows him to Mumbai and despite his mother's disapproval, the billionaire remains enchanted by Ria.  Though lavishly mounted, the first half is routine with emphasis on the rich-boy-meets-poor-girl angle. Post intermission, the real plot is unravelled. Though the twists in the tale rest largely on a dry medical fact, the film becomes a thrilling roller-coaster ride with terrific punches. The mother-son relationship is emotionally gratifying. In a lighter vein, it's Adhyayan's turn to borrow a line out of Yash Chopra's Deewar and preen like Shashi Kapoor did, saying, \"Mere paas maa hai.\"  For someone so young and inexperienced, Adhyayan turns in a faultless performance. Ariana passes muster. Of the songs, Arijit's rendition of main dhoondne ko zamaane mein that plays with the end credits has that haunting quality.

His highly acclaimed I am Kalam (2010) propagated education for underprivileged children, Jalpari (2012) was against female foeticide and it doesn't take long for you to realize that Babloo Happy Hai intends to raise awareness about HIV/Aids.  While all three manage to get the message across, the previous two films were far superior in terms of execution as they didn't succumb to the diktats of commercial cinema.  Is Babloo an entertaining mass-market film for youngsters or made with a serious intention to fight AIDS and look after its survivors? The film faces an identity crisis. It implies a tension between the filmmaker's vision and the genre's demands, diluting its core purpose. The subplots and songs are entertaining but don't add any value to the narrative and there lies its fault. You also wonder why it has been promoted as an adult comedy!

Debutant director Vinil Mathew's straight-forward approach is smart and fresh; his characters are lovable. Nikhil(Sidharth Malhotra) is an optimist, who believes once committed, there's no straying. Meeta(Parineeti Chopra) is a non-conformist; she's a go-getter in her personal and professional space. Naturally Nikhil and Meeta's ideologies don't match. But there's an under-current in their equation that keeps the audience hoping they that they will seek each other out.  Ok, so why aren't these two together in the first place? Is it only because they are poles apart as people? No, it's because Nikhil is engaged to be married to Meeta's elder sister Karishma. And, Meeta herself has been missing from the family scene for seven long years chasing her professional dream.  It is only when the prodigal returns, does she realise that there's an emotional void in her life. Besides her father who dotes on her, she also feels the need for a companion like Nikhil who can put her topsy-turvy life into perspective.  movie  This romantic comedy mirrors the quirks in human nature subtly and provides humour in everyday situations; in the family and amongst friends. Parineeti's relationship with her father(Manoj Joshi, in fine form) strikes the right emotional chord.  The songs--Shake It like Shammi and the Punjabi Wedding Song add zing to an otherwise simple narrative. Parineeti who has come to represent the power-house performer passes with flying colours. And, Sidharth, whose good-looks distract, shows a definitive growth in his second outing as an actor after Student of the Year.  If you're looking to rediscover the magic of goofy love around Valentines, give HTP a shot.

The portions are large, so everything is served one by two. In the 'Specials' we have a daringly different product of Bollywood, Abhay Deol. With a storyline that wants to leap out of mundane romcoms. Some spark of comedy, some feathery feel-good scenes. And some good music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) for the hungry soul. We'll come back to what's 'not hot' on the menu, for now let's dig in.  Everything in Amit Sharma's (Abhay) life is unbearably boring. Starting with his name, of course. He's in a permanently pakaoed (like deep fried French fries) and purposeless state of mind - with a nagging mom (Rati) who buys him stretchable underwear and emotionally blackmails him to opt for a quick-fix boredom solution called shaadi. His college sweetheart dumps him for being as mundane as manchow soup on a date. And to top it, thanks to his 'gas'tronomical indulgences (blame it on 'pakaoed paneer') he's a good ol' fart too. He believes, when life throws shit at you, you need a lot of toilet paper. Phrrr!  movie  On the other side, Samara (Preeti - pretty, super confident and shows promise) raised by single-mom (Lillete-good act!) is aspiring to be famous dancer by winning a dance reality show. She's exasperated with her mom who has a date with the daru bottle every night, and an ex-boyfriend who can bed anything for benefit. Her mantra is 'clean up the shit'. Amit and Samara's paths almost cross, but they miss each other each time by a split second. Eventually, after all the 'shit happens' and is flushed out; fate has fresh plans for them.  Debutante Devika's concept might look good on paper, but onscreen it dissipates like diarrhoea. Strung with a few laughable scenes, it scrambles around with too many plots crafted like episodic sitcoms. It intends to reflect the psyche of the 'wuzdat' generation but quickly crumbles like an out-of-love, casual sex relationship. Abhay is good in his part, but after his super performance in 'Raanjhanaa' he's not at his peak here.  If your stomach is still growling, your table for two (stars) is ready!

He rips, roars and ravages the raavans with a single blow - like a Stallone on steroids. Jai (Salman) is an ex-Army officer, who runs a garage part-time and plays incredibly good (looking) Samaritan fulltime, beating up baddies to bloody pulp with anything from hockey sticks, chains, scaffolding and even a mighty pen. During one 'good-deed' demo, he's hit by a brainwave - a thought that can change the world! His funda seems profound but is simple. Goodness is redeemable. If someone shows you a random act of kindness, you pay it forward to three people. And they'll pass on the 'act of kindness' to three more each. A multiplier effect on millions - snowballing into a mass junta movement of goodness.

While the film has been lavishly mounted because it supports Bollywood's nepotism, practice of a producer (Suneel Darshan) making a show reel for his son (Shiv Darshan), scant respect is paid to even trying to give you a halfway decent story with contemporary treatment. Instead, you are introduced to Shiv's (Kabir) skills to ride, fight, dance, romance and cry in that order.  Keeping him company is a girl Hasleen (Preet). Borrowing other characters like a group of bad boys, some nerds and some more scantily clad girls straight out of 1970s-80s cinema, the film has a string of artificially created situations - like a bike ride, a fight, a lap-dance, a kiss, all strung together with one obvious objective. 'Hello - please meet my son. He has decided to become an actor. And he needs to show you what he is capable of while you stay captive. Also while you fidget in your seat, please check out the new girl we chose for him to romance. She can parade in a bikini, sing, dance and mouth some audacious lines.'  Dialogue like 'either you have *shit in your b*m or dum in your b*m*' make you cringe. The film is full of cliches of mainstream cinema. And the characters, like the parents of the boy, the quiet suffering mother of the girl, the villain (DG) who owns a meat factory, his spoilt son (Jazz), the son's sidekick (Goldie), are caricatures that have been a part of Bollywood potboilers for eons. It's time to bury these fast and furiously, rather than attempt to glorify them like KPK does.  For a debut, Shiv displays a tiny spark. Hasleen shows spunk.

A bunch of ready-to-titillate starlets, crude men waiting to pull out their 'pistols', rubber-faced monsters melting in blood, cranky beds on tawdry sets, shaky hand-held cameras and shady lighting. A few minutes later some loud moans and mews. Ahh! Lights, camera and crude carnal pleasures!  'Miss Lovely', unfolds with this premise, set in the Mumbai of 1980's where sleazy, sex-horror films are mass-churned by the thriving C-grade movie industry, with depraved delight and unchaste ambitions.

Very rarely do films focus on simple and light-hearted everyday conversation. Gupta brings that aspect to the forefront with the beautiful backdrop of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi (or Delhi-6, thanks to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra).  We also liked the fact that though based on the hero's love for theatre, most songs and scenes don't look theatrical. Gupta keeps it real with locations, performances, interactions. While the sight of scrumptious paranthas and pickle leave you salivating, lack of a concrete plot coupled with the film's stagnant pace also unfortunately leave you hungry and tired.  Plus, the story lacks direction; it wanders around aimlessly, lacking continuity and failing to connect with the audience. This makes you question the motive of the film. For example, the protagonist Maulik (Anuj Saxena), a theatre actor/director, who struggles to get himself a show, goes on and on about his passion for 'theatre', but his actions do not back his words. We don't feel for his character or his love for the art, which is the biggest drawback of the film. Saxena is a tad too understated for his character.  On the contrary, his young heroine (Neha Pawar), who plays a loud Punjaban, tries to imitate Anushka Sharma and ends up looking over-animated in most scenes. She gets better when she's herself. The lead actors have good screen presence but need to undergo voice modulation for their pitch stays constant. The chemistry between the two doesn't work either. Supporting actors are pleasant, but don't add much to the proceedings. The abrupt climax doesn't live up to the strong initial build-up either.  Gupta's feel-good parantha lacks spice and makkhan.

Helping hormone-rushed youngsters slide into puberty and outta tight-fitting pants. 'Yaariyan' could have been the word. About friends, first-kisses and hot flushes. Peppered with candy-crushes and teenage desires furthest from reality. So we have Bettys and Veronicas crushing on extra-smiley Archies, all the while shaking their 'toohs' and 'tees' (beep, beep!) at beach parties. Of course, with thoda ambition, kuch-kuch competition, and mostly out-of-classroom lessons.  Presenting the leads of 'Gen-Y'. Lakshya (Himansh) the college casanova who spends all his time trying to get his first kiss with some sexy miss. Neil (Dev), the biker boy (minus hot babes), Pardi (Shreyas), the Jughead in the batch, but not hotdog enough for the gals. The plain-Jane, all-brain, Saloni (Rakul) who knows more about gigabytes than love-bytes. And the oomphy Jiya (Nicole), prowling all over this campus 'rompus' whipping every boy's fantasy. Their chilled-out lives go into top gear when the principal (Grover) chooses them as the 'Dream Team' to compete with the Aussie students (at sports & music), to save the pride and honour of their college. Suddenly their life is faced with new challenges, newer angles and love-triangles. To add more chapters, there are dramatic maas, horny teachers and their 'busty' subjects.  movie  Divya's debut film 'Yaariyan', a comparatively small-budget film coming from a big banner, is mounted on a large canvas with impressive production value. The star-cast is all-new and enthusiastic; and most of all the music boasts of chartbusting numbers. Himansh's attempt is sincere, but Mr. Emoticon needs to flash his big-toothy smiley a little less. Rakul is very likeable and promising, Dev is subtle, Shreyas is good but often OTT, and Nicole fits the 'brief' (pun intended!).  Now the lows. The story has twists and turns, but no surprises. It packs in too much variety of thought bubbles (parties, patriotism, racial discrimination) in this boarding school drama. There are emotions, but the scenes or characters don't go deeper than the gloss, flipping quicker than their touch screen smart phones. The runtime is a tad long and songs (well-shot) one too many.  'Yaariyan' is nothing to gush about, but the teenies can watch this one for a lark...and some yo-yo beats!

Like its prequel, the idiom and the setting are rural. The spoken language is Hindi with a peppering of heavy-duty Urdu. Thank God for the English subtitles in circuits except the Hindi belt! What's also nice is the contemporary thought woven in (with references to Iphone-5 and hamburgers in New York). So, the desi-yuppies can connect.  The plot, with many interesting twists, is about the irrepressible team of crooks, Khallu and Babban (Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi respectively). When these two arrive in Mehmudabad, Naseer finds himself magnetically drawn to the local heiress, Begum Para (Madhuri Dixit Nene). And Arshad falls head over heels in love with the Begum's aide, Muniya (Huma Qureshi). The uncle-nephew team chase their love interests and build castles in the air about sex, life and wealth.  movie  The women, Begum Para and Muniya, also have a back-story. Para is the widow of a debauched Nawab who gambled away his wealth on men and wine. Her crazy suitor, Jaan Mohammad (Vijay Raaz) wants to bail her out.  In their attempt to live happily ever after, Begum and Muniya devise their own Thelma and Louise (the 1991 Hollywood flick) kind of plan. Not willing to give up, Khallu and Baban try hard to fit in.  Vishal Bharadwaj's dialogue keeps you in splits. The free usage of words like sex and chu**yapaa tickle the funny bone. Naseer is back in super-form after straying in outings like Jackpot. Ditto Arshad. Madhuri looks gorgeous but the dhak-dhak girl (now woman) falls short on the oomph meter, as compared to Vidya Balan in Ishqiya. Huma Qureshi is interesting.  "},{"Name":"Mr Joe B. Carvalho","Release Time":"Apr 26 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Arshad Warsi, Soha Ali Khan, Jaaved Jafferi, Shakti Kapoor","Director":"Samir Tewari","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Hell breaks loose throughout the duration of debutant film director Samir Tewari's Mr Joe B Carvalho because there's a daft detective (Arshad Warsi), an eloped heiress (Geeta Basra), some crazy assassins (Jaaved Jafferi, Vijay Raaz, Vrajesh Hirjee), some incompetent cops headed by Soha Ali Khan and God alone who else, chasing one another's tail in madcap situations set against the backdrop of a marriage.  Ideally, this detective comic-thriller that spoofs mainstream Hindi cinema in a small degree attempts to be somewhat like Hollywood's Naked Gun series. And it should have made for a goofy film. But after a promising start, Joe B... fails.  movie  Forget laughter, the frequent use of in-house jokes and one-liners that are staples with actors like Arshad Warsi and Jaaved Jafferi, who have built their personalities around comic repartee, fall flat in the film because they are so amateurish.  When you are asked to laugh at a visually-impaired person (Himani Shivpuri) falling off balconies or bumping into furniture, or the cross-dressing killer Carlos (Jafferi) — who keeps uttering, Carlos, maut (death) aur potti (shit) come unannounced' or the lollipop-licking Joe B Carvalho (whose name is often punned on in Hindi), it's funny for a bit. You can't cackle for two hours over such insensitivity.  Arshad is a competent actor and does justice to the daft detective role. Soha tries her best to seduce Arshad and the camera in a bikini, mini and a towel. However unlike her mother Sharmila Tagore, Soha lacks sensuality. Himani Shivpuri is good. But the rest of the actors ham.  It's a pity that the writer and director didn't pay more attention. Had the film been as honourable as their intentions seemed (of making a clean comedy that is neither slapstick nor adult), this genre may have actually got a fillip.

While one doesn't expect much of a novelty in terms of story when it comes to horror, cliched execution cannot be forgiven. For starters, the film offers standard scary occurrences like doors opening by themselves, drawers banging and children crying used as background score.  movie  None of these 'tried-and-tested' methods manage to shock you, barring a chilling ice skating scene. Also, the plot is extremely predictable. Since you can tell how it's going to end, the big suspense annoys more and thrills less. The languid pace doesn't help either. Extensive use of found-footage style cinematography is not easy on the eyes.  Besides, a few deviations in the story are uncalled for. A side-track comprises of a bunch of bickering rich kids, out to party at the nightclub in the mall. Why would anyone party in that deserted mall in the first place? A guy making out with a firang item girl (who roughly resembles Yana Gupta) has been strictly added to titillate the frontbenchers.  Jimmy Sheirgill's acting prowess is vastly underrated. In spite of being a good actor, he ends up playing second fiddle. The damsel in distress (Nushrat Bharucha) ends up getting more footage. Jimmy's torch-wielding role doesn't require him to do much except for using the flashlight to locate evil spirits. This hide-and-seek gets boring after a while as the buildup itself runs out of steam. Never mind the climax.  The film might work for those who get frightened easily. For fans of the genre, watch Ragini MMS instead, if you still haven't.  "},{"Name":"Highway","Release Time":"Apr 26 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Randeep Hooda, Alia Bhatt","Director":"Imtiaz Ali","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 14 minutes","Review":" Straight up, Highway is not a sunny, funny road-trip. It is Imtiaz Ali's starkest, darkest work yet. Rich Veera (Bhatt) steps away from her Monsoon Wedding-style shaadi preparations (a handheld camera capturing gold, ghaghras and a girl going, \"Bhaiyya, flavvers lappet do!\") for a break with her reluctant fiance. Driving into a foggy Delhi night, Veera steps out to breathe free - and gets kidnapped by violent criminal Mahavir Bhaati (Hooda) and his gang. Gagged, tied-up, slapped and starved, Veera's thrown onto a terrifying truck that drives off on a never-ending highway, leaving established society far behind. What does Veera experience on this trip?  movie  Highway belongs unabashedly to Alia Bhatt. Her Veera is stunning - sincere and simple, prettily earnest, shakily emotional. Bhatt's range and prowess are evident in her timid confidence, the slow swagger Veera gains as she takes control of the situation, captivating her captor, confronting assault. Hooda's Mahavir is frightening, tightly controlled, the actor conveying dark dislike with crackling tension, switching to bewilderment with comic ease. Alongside, Aaroo (Durgesh Kumar), Mahavir's companion, who breaks into a delightful trance-wala dance with Veera as she sways to 'English music' on the road, is memorable.  But what stamps this film indelibly is its sheer boldness. Imtiaz Ali must be congratulated for his daring novelty, for a powerful heroine-centric story, for his heroine who looks like a Vermeer painting dressed in a dusty ghaghra. At times, Highway feels like an unending Bharat darshan, a long look at suffering souls through several deserts and eucalyptus trees. But some meandering is its only flaw. Watch it for its cathartic creativity, for colours akin to Iranian palettes, for sound design where melting qawwalis, chirruping crickets and a screeching train make layers of noise - for that shot where Veera rests her head on a pillow of water.  Highway is not an easy ride. But it offers fresh breezes and new sights.

Gunday is Oliver Twist, given a Bollywood twist. Orphaned Bala (Kapoor) saves waif Bikram (Singh) from a paedophile in war-torn Bangladesh. Escaping officials, the two boys reach Calcutta, hiding on a train. Facing homelessness and heartlessness, the duo decides to conquer life, selling stolen coal - till they become Calcutta's most famous gundey, controlling all its illegal trading from timber to fish. Bikram and Bala are tough, cheerful and inseparable - until they both fall for cabaret dancer Nandita (Chopra). As they bitterly fall out with each other, ACP Satyajit Sarkar (Khan) closes in for the kill.  movie  Gunday showcases refugee Robin Hoods refusing to be beaten. Its music has peppy, bright dil while its muscular action is hard-hitting. Irrfan stands out as the sarcastically drawling cop while Arjun displays endearing vulnerability as dark-natured Bala. Ranveer endows Bikram with a charming, if familiar swagger while Priyanka infuses Nandita with languid sexiness. However, the plot distractedly rushes in several directions - refugee angst, ration cards, the system's rot, gang wars, bromance, romance, broken bromance - while Calcutta appears like a Wild West of the east, fringed by Chambal-like landscapes through which goods trains sway, gundas bashing each other to coal dust atop. Gunday's heart is in the right place but the plot gets overwhelmed by its own voluptuousness, its slick torsos and slow-motion slaps, its extended Durga Puja which leaves it lost between Calcutta's cabarets and Dhanbad's dark mines.  However, Gunday's fun while it lasts. Bala and Bikram's chemistry is literally fleshed out well - don't miss the cheeky salaam to Salman Khan when their shirts fly off - and you giggle as they're scolded, \"Daant mat dikhao!\" More depth, more fire would've sharpened this film. But Gunday offers glitter coating a grim tale.

For his own vested interest, he incites violence by convincing the fickle-minded youngsters into believing that they must kill in order to safeguard Islam.  Fighting Jilani's beliefs is another staunch Muslim with a conflicting ideology - the righteous Dr Mazhar (Manzar Sehbai). He dares to expose the maulana and propagates the teachings of Islam. ATS officer Ranvijay Singh (Ajaz Khan) helps Dr Mazhar in countering terrorism in the name of jihad. Can they foil Jilani's vicious terrorist plot and save the young couple Imran (Vikram Singh) and Amreen (Arjumman Mughal), who also get embroiled in the deadly situation?  Ya Rab is an honest attempt to debar stereotypes and the image of Islam based on false notions, reiterating that no religion expects you to harm others, let alone take innocent lives. However, we have seen films raising this issue in a more mature way before.  It may have started out as a noble intention, but the film's execution is outdated and comes across as cliched. You have deafening music every time the villain makes an appearance and he (Akhilendra Mishra) screams at the top of his lungs to look evil. Newcomer Arjumman Mughal acts well. Ajaz Khan has a good screen presence, but exudes a rough demeanour, that's more akin to a crook. The dialogues are way too dramatic, instead of hard-hitting. The linear storyline and overtly simplistic narrative may appeal to those who prefer the formulaic cinema of the 80s. Thus, the film might find appeal in mass audiences, which explains its style.

The film, nicely adapted and understated (except for the misplaced title track) deals with the disturbingly real phenomenon of anesthetic awareness in which surgery patients, though paralyzed are conscious of everything they are experiencing including pain. It's an absorbing thriller. And one doffs one's hat to Shekhar for handling this difficult subject with such finesse.  The protagonist Aditya (Adhyayan Suman) is molly-coddled and stifled by his rich mother Gayatri (Deepti Naval). He also has a life-threatening heart ailment and needs a transplant. His mother's silent admirer Dr Trehaan (Om Puri) is the ideal choice of medic. However, Adi seeks out his friend, a lesser known surgeon Sameer (Shekhar Suman) and entrusts him with his life.  movie  Richie Rich also finds himself drawn to Ria (Ariana Ayam), a receptionist at a Dubai hotel. Their love blossoms after two songs and a tour of Dubai. She follows him to Mumbai and despite his mother's disapproval, the billionaire remains enchanted by Ria.  Though lavishly mounted, the first half is routine with emphasis on the rich-boy-meets-poor-girl angle. Post intermission, the real plot is unravelled. Though the twists in the tale rest largely on a dry medical fact, the film becomes a thrilling roller-coaster ride with terrific punches. The mother-son relationship is emotionally gratifying. In a lighter vein, it's Adhyayan's turn to borrow a line out of Yash Chopra's Deewar and preen like Shashi Kapoor did, saying, \"Mere paas maa hai.\"  For someone so young and inexperienced, Adhyayan turns in a faultless performance. Ariana passes muster. Of the songs, Arijit's rendition of main dhoondne ko zamaane mein that plays with the end credits has that haunting quality.

His highly acclaimed I am Kalam (2010) propagated education for underprivileged children, Jalpari (2012) was against female foeticide and it doesn't take long for you to realize that Babloo Happy Hai intends to raise awareness about HIV/Aids.  While all three manage to get the message across, the previous two films were far superior in terms of execution as they didn't succumb to the diktats of commercial cinema.  Is Babloo an entertaining mass-market film for youngsters or made with a serious intention to fight AIDS and look after its survivors? The film faces an identity crisis. It implies a tension between the filmmaker's vision and the genre's demands, diluting its core purpose. The subplots and songs are entertaining but don't add any value to the narrative and there lies its fault. You also wonder why it has been promoted as an adult comedy! Also, the title bears no relevance to the story.  Despite the shortcomings, the film manages to keep you engaged, thanks to the strong performances by the three lead actors and gorgeous cinematography.

The portions are large, so everything is served one by two. In the 'Specials' we have a daringly different product of Bollywood, Abhay Deol. With a storyline that wants to leap out of mundane romcoms. Some spark of comedy, some feathery feel-good scenes. And some good music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) for the hungry soul. We'll come back to what's 'not hot' on the menu, for now let's dig in.  Everything in Amit Sharma's (Abhay) life is unbearably boring. Starting with his name, of course. He's in a permanently pakaoed (like deep fried French fries) and purposeless state of mind - with a nagging mom (Rati) who buys him stretchable underwear and emotionally blackmails him to opt for a quick-fix boredom solution called shaadi. His college sweetheart dumps him for being as mundane as manchow soup on a date. And to top it, thanks to his 'gas'tronomical indulgences (blame it on 'pakaoed paneer') he's a good ol' fart too. He believes, when life throws shit at you, you need a lot of toilet paper. Phrrr!  movie  On the other side, Samara (Preeti - pretty, super confident and shows promise) raised by single-mom (Lillete-good act!) is aspiring to be famous dancer by winning a dance reality show. She's exasperated with her mom who has a date with the daru bottle every night, and an ex-boyfriend who can bed anything for benefit. Her mantra is 'clean up the shit'. Amit and Samara's paths almost cross, but they miss each other each time by a split second. Eventually, after all the 'shit happens' and is flushed out; fate has fresh plans for them.  Debutante Devika's concept might look good on paper, but onscreen it dissipates like diarrhoea. Strung with a few laughable scenes, it scrambles around with too many plots crafted like episodic sitcoms. It intends to reflect the psyche of the 'wuzdat' generation but quickly crumbles like an out-of-love, casual sex relationship. Abhay is good in his part, but after his super performance in 'Raanjhanaa' he's not at his peak here.  If your stomach is still growling, your table for two (stars) is ready!

He rips, roars and ravages the raavans with a single blow - like a Stallone on steroids. Jai (Salman) is an ex-Army officer, who runs a garage part-time and plays incredibly good (looking) Samaritan fulltime, beating up baddies to bloody pulp with anything from hockey sticks, chains, scaffolding and even a mighty pen. During one 'good-deed' demo, he's hit by a brainwave - a thought that can change the world! His funda seems profound but is simple. Goodness is redeemable. If someone shows you a random act of kindness, you pay it forward to three people. And they'll pass on the 'act of kindness' to three more each. A multiplier effect on millions - snowballing into a mass junta movement of goodness.

While the film has been lavishly mounted because it supports Bollywood's nepotism, practice of a producer (Suneel Darshan) making a show reel for his son (Shiv Darshan), scant respect is paid to even trying to give you a halfway decent story with contemporary treatment. Instead, you are introduced to Shiv's (Kabir) skills to ride, fight, dance, romance and cry in that order.  Keeping him company is a girl Hasleen (Preet). Borrowing other characters like a group of bad boys, some nerds and some more scantily clad girls straight out of 1970s-80s cinema, the film has a string of artificially created situations - like a bike ride, a fight, a lap-dance, a kiss, all strung together with one obvious objective. 'Hello - please meet my son. He has decided to become an actor. And he needs to show you what he is capable of while you stay captive. Also while you fidget in your seat, please check out the new girl we chose for him to romance. She can parade in a bikini, sing, dance and mouth some audacious lines.'  Dialogue like 'either you have *shit in your b*m or dum in your b*m*' make you cringe. The film is full of cliches of mainstream cinema. And the characters, like the parents of the boy, the quiet suffering mother of the girl, the villain (DG) who owns a meat factory, his spoilt son (Jazz), the son's sidekick (Goldie), are caricatures that have been a part of Bollywood potboilers for eons. It's time to bury these fast and furiously, rather than attempt to glorify them like KPK does.  For a debut, Shiv displays a tiny spark. Hasleen shows spunk.

A bunch of ready-to-titillate starlets, crude men waiting to pull out their 'pistols', rubber-faced monsters melting in blood, cranky beds on tawdry sets, shaky hand-held cameras and shady lighting. A few minutes later some loud moans and mews. Ahh! Lights, camera and crude carnal pleasures!  'Miss Lovely', unfolds with this premise, set in the Mumbai of 1980's where sleazy, sex-horror films are mass-churned by the thriving C-grade movie industry, with depraved delight and unchaste ambitions.

Very rarely do films focus on simple and light-hearted everyday conversation. Gupta brings that aspect to the forefront with the beautiful backdrop of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi (or Delhi-6, thanks to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra).  We also liked the fact that though based on the hero's love for theatre, most songs and scenes don't look theatrical. Gupta keeps it real with locations, performances, interactions. While the sight of scrumptious paranthas and pickle leave you salivating, lack of a concrete plot coupled with the film's stagnant pace also unfortunately leave you hungry and tired.  Plus, the story lacks direction; it wanders around aimlessly, lacking continuity and failing to connect with the audience. This makes you question the motive of the film. For example, the protagonist Maulik (Anuj Saxena), a theatre actor/director, who struggles to get himself a show, goes on and on about his passion for 'theatre', but his actions do not back his words. We don't feel for his character or his love for the art, which is the biggest drawback of the film. Saxena is a tad too understated for his character.  On the contrary, his young heroine (Neha Pawar), who plays a loud Punjaban, tries to imitate Anushka Sharma and ends up looking over-animated in most scenes. She gets better when she's herself. The lead actors have good screen presence but need to undergo voice modulation for their pitch stays constant. The chemistry between the two doesn't work either. Supporting actors are pleasant, but don't add much to the proceedings. The abrupt climax doesn't live up to the strong initial build-up either.  Gupta's feel-good parantha lacks spice and makkhan.

Helping hormone-rushed youngsters slide into puberty and outta tight-fitting pants. 'Yaariyan' could have been the word. About friends, first-kisses and hot flushes. Peppered with candy-crushes and teenage desires furthest from reality. So we have Bettys and Veronicas crushing on extra-smiley Archies, all the while shaking their 'toohs' and 'tees' (beep, beep!) at beach parties. Of course, with thoda ambition, kuch-kuch competition, and mostly out-of-classroom lessons.  Presenting the leads of 'Gen-Y'. Lakshya (Himansh) the college casanova who spends all his time trying to get his first kiss with some sexy miss. Neil (Dev), the biker boy (minus hot babes), Pardi (Shreyas), the Jughead in the batch, but not hotdog enough for the gals. The plain-Jane, all-brain, Saloni (Rakul) who knows more about gigabytes than love-bytes. And the oomphy Jiya (Nicole), prowling all over this campus 'rompus' whipping every boy's fantasy. Their chilled-out lives go into top gear when the principal (Grover) chooses them as the 'Dream Team' to compete with the Aussie students (at sports & music), to save the pride and honour of their college. Suddenly their life is faced with new challenges, newer angles and love-triangles. To add more chapters, there are dramatic maas, horny teachers and their 'busty' subjects.  movie  Divya's debut film 'Yaariyan', a comparatively small-budget film coming from a big banner, is mounted on a large canvas with impressive production value. The star-cast is all-new and enthusiastic; and most of all the music boasts of chartbusting numbers. Himansh's attempt is sincere, but Mr. Emoticon needs to flash his big-toothy smiley a little less. Rakul is very likeable and promising, Dev is subtle, Shreyas is good but often OTT, and Nicole fits the 'brief' (pun intended!).  Now the lows. The story has twists and turns, but no surprises. It packs in too much variety of thought bubbles (parties, patriotism, racial discrimination) in this boarding school drama. There are emotions, but the scenes or characters don't go deeper than the gloss, flipping quicker than their touch screen smart phones. The runtime is a tad long and songs (well-shot) one too many.  'Yaariyan' is nothing to gush about, but the teenies can watch this one for a lark...and some yo-yo beats!

Like its prequel, the idiom and the setting are rural. The spoken language is Hindi with a peppering of heavy-duty Urdu. Thank God for the English subtitles in circuits except the Hindi belt! What's also nice is the contemporary thought woven in (with references to Iphone-5 and hamburgers in New York). So, the desi-yuppies can connect.  The plot, with many interesting twists, is about the irrepressible team of crooks, Khallu and Babban (Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi respectively). When these two arrive in Mehmudabad, Naseer finds himself magnetically drawn to the local heiress, Begum Para (Madhuri Dixit Nene). And Arshad falls head over heels in love with the Begum's aide, Muniya (Huma Qureshi). The uncle-nephew team chase their love interests and build castles in the air about sex, life and wealth.  movie  The women, Begum Para and Muniya, also have a back-story. Para is the widow of a debauched Nawab who gambled away his wealth on men and wine. Her crazy suitor, Jaan Mohammad (Vijay Raaz) wants to bail her out.  In their attempt to live happily ever after, Begum and Muniya devise their own Thelma and Louise (the 1991 Hollywood flick) kind of plan. Not willing to give up, Khallu and Baban try hard to fit in.  Vishal Bharadwaj's dialogue keeps you in splits. The free usage of words like sex and chu**yapaa tickle the funny bone. Naseer is back in super-form after straying in outings like Jackpot. Ditto Arshad. Madhuri looks gorgeous but the dhak-dhak girl (now woman) falls short on the oomph meter, as compared to Vidya Balan in Ishqiya. Huma Qureshi is interesting.  "},{"Name":"Mr Joe B. Carvalho","Release Time":"Apr 26 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Arshad Warsi, Soha Ali Khan, Jaaved Jafferi, Shakti Kapoor","Director":"Samir Tewari","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Hell breaks loose throughout the duration of debutant film director Samir Tewari's Mr Joe B Carvalho because there's a daft detective (Arshad Warsi), an eloped heiress (Geeta Basra), some crazy assassins (Jaaved Jafferi, Vijay Raaz, Vrajesh Hirjee), some incompetent cops headed by Soha Ali Khan and God alone who else, chasing one another's tail in madcap situations set against the backdrop of a marriage.  Ideally, this detective comic-thriller that spoofs mainstream Hindi cinema in a small degree attempts to be somewhat like Hollywood's Naked Gun series. And it should have made for a goofy film. But after a promising start, Joe B... fails.  movie  Forget laughter, the frequent use of in-house jokes and one-liners that are staples with actors like Arshad Warsi and Jaaved Jafferi, who have built their personalities around comic repartee, fall flat in the film because they are so amateurish.  When you are asked to laugh at a visually-impaired person (Himani Shivpuri) falling off balconies or bumping into furniture, or the cross-dressing killer Carlos (Jafferi) — who keeps uttering, Carlos, maut (death) aur potti (shit) come unannounced' or the lollipop-licking Joe B Carvalho (whose name is often punned on in Hindi), it's funny for a bit. You can't cackle for two hours over such insensitivity.  Arshad is a competent actor and does justice to the daft detective role. Soha tries her best to seduce Arshad and the camera in a bikini, mini and a towel. However unlike her mother Sharmila Tagore, Soha lacks sensuality. Himani Shivpuri is good. But the rest of the actors ham.  It's a pity that the writer and director didn't pay more attention. Had the film been as honourable as their intentions seemed (of making a clean comedy that is neither slapstick nor adult), this genre may have actually got a fillip.

Parth is accompanied by girlfriend Geetali (Sukhada Yash), Eric (Edward Sonnenblick), an international student pursuing a Masters in Anthropology, Avdya (local Wari expert) and cinematographer Amol (DOP Amol Gole plays himself). To capture Maharashtra's most revered voyage on camera, they travel with the Waarkaris, who walk 240 kms in 18 days! The experience turns out to be a life-altering journey for Parth as 18 days signify 18 chapters (Adyay) of the Dnyaneshwari (a commentary on the Bhagwad Gita).  Made on a modest budget, Mokssh scores in almost all departments, story and authenticity, imagination, cinematography, dialogues and performances. Scenes where the Waarkaris express their love for Vithoba are heart-rending. Casting is brilliant as acclaimed Marathi actor Chinmay Mandlekar plays the protagonist with perfection. You feel his pain as he strives to fulfill his passion without compromising on his principles. You can identify with his restlessness. His relentless search for a deeper meaning in life makes you introspect. Supporting actors make their mark as well. The real Waari footage shot by Gole is breathtaking.  The film, however, has its share of flaws. A few portions are dubbed and not re-shot, which is distracting. At times the Adhyays bear no relevance to the contemporary setting, as is the objective. The farmers' plight issue seems a tad out of place.  Nonetheless, if salvation is what you seek, Mokssh is liberating. Like Parth, you may find your answers too. At times, while analysing someone else's behaviour or studying their nature, you end up discovering yours. Faith is all it takes...take this emotional voyage.

Fully relevant today because it deals with basic human characteristics like greed, duty, fidelity and selflessness, this animated version is like a refresher course for those who may not be well-versed with the Ramayana and Mahabharata.  The plot line of this epic, that has always been the basic fabric from which all story-telling in India is woven, remains unchanged. So you have the five-man army of the Pandavas with their common wife Draupadi (Panchali) pitted against the 100 Kauravas led by Duryodhan. So fragile is the ego, that one mere insult is enough to wage war. Drunk on her own beauty and power Draupadi rebuts Duryodhana. And, her unkind words have far reaching consequences. A long-drawn battle ensues and mayhem stops only when Lord Krishna intervenes.  What makes this version thoroughly enjoyable is the talent that has lent its voice to each of the prominent characters. And there's a bonus too because the filmmakers have also tried to bring out a facial resemblance between the animated character and the actor who has dubbed for it.  Amitabh Bachchan's bartitone is used for the stellar Bheeshma Pitamah. Although the Big B doesn't have muscular arms like his animated counterpart, their faces match. A superlative list of actors like Ajay Devgn (Arjun), Manoj Bajpayee (Yudhisthir), Sunny Deol (Bheem), Anil Kapoor (Karan), Jackie Shroff (Duryodhan), Anupam Kher (Shakuni) and Vidya Balan (Draupadi) have also infused life into the computer generated characters with their inimitable voices.  On the flip side, the animation effort itself is immature and several notches below those of Hollywood films. Yet the dub effort by the Bollywood superstars uplifts this epic, making it enjoyable.

The most emotional of the Dhoom series yet, this is Aamir Khan's show all the way. As revengeful circus star Sahir, whose father Iqbal (Shroff) dies after losing his beloved Great Indian Circus to a stony-hearted Chicago bank, Khan is terrific. The Dhoom series usually showcases brawn on bikes but in this one, mind meets machinery, Khan's brain almost visibly ticking behind his eyes, calculating every second before he vrroooms off on a bike - across a wire stretched high between buildings, beneath a mega-truck, even underwater.  Chicago forms a super backdrop for Sahir's stunts, the grainy stone of its buildings the perfect texture against which those bikes purr past with velveteen growls. Scrawling 'Teri aisi ki taisi' on its vaults and scattering the bank's money across Chicago's skies, Sahir makes the local police look as intelligent as turkeys. But things change when Mumbai cop ACP Jai Dixit (Bachchan), with bike-and-babe-mad subordinate Ali (Chopra), arrive and figure out why - and how - Sahir is breaking the bank.  movie  Dhoom 3 rests on Khan's magnetism, his actor's eyes and jaw-line, his abs playing a part too. But the film is powered by its action. With WOL (whistle-out-loud) moments, this is super-slick and on an extravagant scale, using Chicago's skyscrapers like sexy statues arching into the sky. Alongside, Dhoom 3 features the franchise's tongue-in-cheek cheekiness, Ali, fida over blonde policewoman Victoria (as in 'secret'), Jai telling him to focus not on Kamasutra but kaam. As circus star Alia, Kaif provides soft romance, her fitness and innate grace redefining sexiness, making even potentially risque sequences - she lands her job following a speedy striptease - look delicately sensuous. Alia's charming beauty stops our protagonist in his tracks - but for how long?  Clocking in at nearly three hours, Dhoom 3 is slightly extensive. But it holds advantages, the first, that sizzling Dhoom tune, all leather, boots and electric guitars, which straightens sagging scenes. The second - sharp performances by Khan, Bachchan (an underrated actor, whose ability to drawl languid lines with intense looks stands out) and Chopra, who sprinkles lightness and fun. And the third - Dhoom 3's story with a twist wrapped around it, like the ribbon around a Christmas gift. Merrily unwrap - flying out of the Great Indian Circus, Dhoom 3 is great fun.

Francis (Joshi) packs in the muscle and has a can of beer always close at hand. He is also street-smart enough to impress Maya (Leone), the oomphy voice of reason in the movie. Boss Man (Naseeruddin) is a veteran raver whose clothes are as colourful as his principles and punchlines. Slow in speech but quick to draw a six-shooter, he owns the Jackpot casino.  Boss, Francis and Maya hatch a plan to steal crores of cash. And while the deed itself is executed decently enough, the subsequent sub-plots and implications of intrigue amongst the schemers is laid on with the predictability and subtlety of a bull in a china shop.  movie  Completely in character, Boss looks and sounds like a parody of a villain. While it's clearly understood that he is the owner of a floating casino, his lines flog every possible gambling pun to death. After a point, you can almost predict what the next one-liner will be. Francis and his other muscle-bound cronies often get into squabbles whenever some suspicion of duplicity arises amongst them.  And those expecting anything even close to a Sunny Leone steam-fest will be disappointed. In fact, she raps the knuckles of the local lads, scolding them if they dare lay their gaze on her bursting-at-the-buttons bosom. \"My eyes are up here, not down there!\" she reminds one local lad. She is also given lines like \"Sarkar aur underworld mein kya farak hai?\"  Similarly, Francis, who later in the movie reminds her that \"Hum log artist hai - con artist!\" and Boss, who reasons out that in his line of work, \"Risky is like whisky\". Makarand Deshpande's kooky cop character is genuinely funny, but corny lines aside, one of Jackpot's few redeeming factors here is that it moves along quickly.

What the Fish has a promising premise and an intriguing start but runs out of steam way too soon. A few minutes into the movie and you'd already guess what the climax could be. The non-linear narrative manages to engage you in the beginning but lack of humour and interesting characters make the execution look a tad tiresome and repetitive.  In terms of treatment, the film borrows from The Hangover's 'What the f*** is going on' theme but falls flat as the writing is unimaginative and predictable. Characters keep walking in and out of the film, with none making a mark. They bear no relevance to the movie, nor do they add an extra element of fun. Thus when they appear out of nowhere and disappear as quickly, you eventually stop wondering what their contribution to the film is.  Every actor does an elaborate cameo of sorts and though the performances are decent, they fail to make their characters 'likeable'. The plot's restrictions need to be blamed. It even makes Dimple Kapadia's tryst with comedy seem loud and forced.  The 'idea' behind the movie can be appreciated for its novelty but it fails to develop into a full-fledged comedy of errors, which was the intention.

To begin with, the title has absolutely no relevance to the film. There is no defined storyline whatsoever. However, the same can't be said about the film's poster, (if you happen to see it). The makers, it seems, have literally shown a middle finger to the audiences, who may have had certain expectations from it. That way, they aren't deceiving!  If Lucky Kabootar was meant to be a romantic comedy, not a single scene makes you laugh or feel the love. The crudity of the language makes you cringe instead. It's only right if Punjabis take offense, for their portrayal is vastly unflattering.  Picture this - you are bombarded with bad sex jokes and random erotic dream sequences, all of which are shot in water! All the characters are water nymphs, we get it! A horny female character hits on Ravi Kishan, shows off ample cleavage and then acts drunk when he doesn't reciprocate her 'feelings'. A pansy guy's name is 'Phussy' (mind the h), and a wish-granting baba is called 'Sexydaas' (Sanjay Mishra borrowing Satya Sai baba's hairdo and yesteryears villain Jeevan's unique nasal twang and trademark dialogue delivery).  The baba's female minions are called Hard drive and Pen drive. A lady politician mispronounces 'Shaks (somebody in Urdu) as Sex' and then keeps repeating it, assuming it's funny. Wonder how the censor board cleared this film with a U/A!  Among the cast, Sanjay Mishra and Kulraj Randhawa are probably the only decent actors and you feel sorry for them for they do their job sincerely. Popular TV actor Eijaz Khan fails to rise above the terrible writing and lacks presence.

Tariq suffers from depression, while Saira struggles to cope with her husband's suicidal tendencies. In an attempt to make a fresh start in life and to get rid of the 'nothingness' that haunts them, they shift to Mumbai from Pune. More than the city's distractions, it's their loud neighbour Manubhai (Raghubir Yadav), who manages to kill the deafening silence that plagues them with his somewhat annoying yet adorable antics. Manubhai introduces Tariq to members of his sports club - where life begins at 60.  Club 60 has its heart in the right place. Sanjay Tripathy makes an earnest attempt to reach out to the elderly, who seek purpose in life. This one scene in particular where Saira doubts her longing for her son is heartbreaking. Farooque Sheikh and Sarika are outstanding. They prove what a huge role and huge difference, a 'good casting' makes in cinema. They hold the film together with their presence, even as the film deviates from tragedy to the unwanted naughty antics of the oldies.  Guess the intention was to show mischief but the club members eying women of all ages and cracking jokes with sexual innuendo, makes them look way too lecherous for your liking. We wish the supporting characters were more defined and sincere. You don't feel much for anyone except for the lead couple. Also the film gets a tad predictable in the second half. Why must everyone have a dark past?  Club 60 is essentially a heartrending tale of a couple, coping with an irreparable loss. In spite of the flaws, you can watch it solely for the immensely talented Farooque Shaikh and the sublime Sarika.  "},{"Name":"R...

'RR' (Shahid) lands in Dhartipur, with his heart on his colourful sleeve, double power in his muscles and bravado in his bones. Flaunting his mawaligiri and 'maar'daangi with equal gusto. One quick encounter with desi beauty Chanda (Sonakshi) and his dil is 'attached' to her for eternity. He woos her aggressively (lovingly calls her Lollipop!), even turns Action Jackson for her, 'breaking a few legs' and tons of bottles. She's no less a razor-tongue firebrand and hard-to-get girl, albeit briefly.  movie  Some gandi baat, chummas, and 'sari falling' scenes later (nothing scandalous!) she melts, and their love story seems complete. Not really! The gaon is infamous for two warring drug dons, Shivraj (Sood) and Parmar (Vidyarthi). 'RR' joins Shivraj and becomes his lead henchman, but soon realizes that Lollipop is Parmar's niece. More trouble ensues' it turns into a 'sarry affair' (everyone seems to fight for a yard of Chanda's sari!) and 'RR' has no choice but to become the new posterboy of the now stereotyped, violent, angry, young man.  Shahid pulls off the tapori act well, dances fabulously, does kickass action and slips in good comic moments. His makeover as action hero can't go unnoticed, but his demolition man act is unconvincing for action larger than his boyish shoulders. He scores better as Romeo than ruffian. Sonakshi has some dumdaar lines but repeats her desi doll act. Sood's dabang-giri works, Asrani (as Shivraj's senile soothsayer) shoots funny one-liners, but his OTTism is sadly stuck in an 80s loop.  While 'R...Rajkumar' entertains at some levels, it suffers from utter plainness and predictability. The raw action is impressive (Ravi Varma), the songs (Pritam) and the choreography are routine attractions. The second half seems like a sari too long and the comedy is often forced.  It has some 'Must Haves' of a pot-boiler, but misses the real thing - a SOLID STORY!

Educated Raja and Rudra are reluctant gangsters, turned by violent, caste-ridden UP politics into what political advisor Srivastava (who Skypes from jail) calls \"political commandos.\" These 'commandos' work at the command of minister Ram Babu Shukla (Babbar), finishing his enemies and finessing his friends. But there's a big bang when Raja and Rudra meet Bajaj (Grover), powerful financier who's rude to the dynamite duo - and gets kidnapped by them. Revenge follows with conspiracies, lots more bang-bang and some LOL jokes.  Hence, opponents are shot during a 'Bak the Talk' shoot, gangster Sumer Yadav (Ravi Kishan, in good form) is told, \"Aap jail ke superstar hain, fan following toh hogi\", Raja tells girlfriend Mitali (Sinha) how he prefers 'noose' and 'jaanwaron ka channel' to serials - and says 'I love you' in a precious scene. All along, the bang-bang cascades and ace cop Arun Singh (Jamwal) is dispatched to kill Raja.  movie  BR scores with its tight performances, Saif terrific with his clenched-jaw comedy, Shergill intense and growlingly funny, Jamwal's flying kicks and wavy hair making the landscape even hotter. Sonakshi's pleasant if unsurprising while Babbar and Grover infuse their roles with oily, kachori-like spice. UP comes alive too as Bullett Raja leaps from Gomti to gaus, sex to sex pistols, Hollywood to Hazratganj, its imagery somewhere between Omkara and Dabangg.  Where the film misses a bulls-eye is an excess 20 minutes, music that, despite Tamanche Pe Disco, remains average and direction that sometimes - don't miss the guy flagellating himself as Saif makes a momentous decision - wavers. Still, BR is a racy ride, cynical, yet sweet, dark, yet bright. Go watch - you'll enjoy those bangs in the dark.

Dia (Kareena), a social worker living in Bengaluru. There she meets the phoren-educated architect Sriram (Imran) - who she calls 'Sridevi'; a misfit and 'black' sheep in a traditional, lungi-clad Tam-Brahm family. He's carefree, casual about love, lazy and shows little humanitarian inkling. She's a fiery, righteous rebel, a mini 'Mother India' who fights for everything 'unfair'. They fall in love, but their ideologies are unaligned, so over some 'tooh-tooh main main', they split up and move on. He moves on to Vasudha (Shraddha), the pretty matrimonial pick, while Dia heads to a remote village in Gujarat.  movie  Soon he realizes his dil beats for Dia, and he follows her all the way to Jhumli gaon. The only way to win her over is to embrace the gobar, gareebi, gais (cows) murghis (though he'd rather see the 'chick(en)s' in a tandoor), and whole bunch of dhoti-clad villagers (straight out of 'Lagaan', even with 'Oh Mitwa' playing in the background for impact). Yes, he even sacrifices his strictly 'chicketarian' diet for dhoklas instead (becharo chhokro!). Lastly, he helps Dia with her mammoth dream of replacing the gaon's shaky rope-bridge with a real one. Now, will 'Sridevi' be able to use his chaalbaazi to crossover to his chhori - That's the idea.  Imran, is most at ease playing Romedy roles, it shows. He's endearing and likeable as a loverboy. Kareena looks stunning in her desi avatar and pulls off the chhori-chichhori with spontaneity and spunk. Shraddha makes a 'pretty' pleasant cameo; and Anupam Kher entertains with his madcap act.  Punit's 'GTPM', is a sweet, breezy romcom with likeable characters presented in glossy, lavish, true Karan Johar (producer) style. In the second half, the 'the bridge over troubled waters' project is a bit stretched, and you wish the gaonwallahs would leave the pair to romance instead. Music (Vishal-Shekhar) is peppy and pleasing.  This isn't the most rousing romance (second-half lacks 'rom'), but has its feel-good moments. Chew it up with some 'Chingam' and a cute date.

Sunny Deol's earnestness shines, throughout the duration of this melodrama. But these guys have to choose better plots to make a point. We've seen a honest collector single-handedly trying to tackle corruption a zillion times. And the treatment; ouch, it hurts more than the hero's blows.  The film's objective is to deify Sunny Deol and simultaneously showcase his famous fists. Bollywood believes that this Jat actor's fists weigh a kilo and a half each.

The answer is, if you are Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who is technically sound and astute, you just become impudent, set the story in Gujarat, sign Bollywood's currently best actress Deepika Padukone (Leela), team her up with 'I've-got-fire-in-my-loins' actor Ranveer Singh (Ram) and then let them loose on one another.  So there's the Sanada clan girl Leela who falls in lust, with her enemy Ram, a Rajadi. Their clans have been at war for 500 years and the exaggeratedly trigger happy lot clearly underline that no matter what one Ram or Leela feel, the rest of the clan only believes in mutiny.  movie  So bullets fly, blood flows and bahus become victims of evil design. In between this war-fare Deepika and Ranveer touch, feel, kiss and cuddle and ensure you can feel their stirring. Unabashedly, the filmmaker uses his lead pair's real and reel chemistry, fuses it with sexual tension and asks you to partake in their love-hate relationship.  For the most part, Ram-Leela, SLB's most commercial work till date, has nice doses of raunch and ras (juice). Since the plot is Shakespearan, the maker has the arduous task of telling you this story on an opulent scale. Vintage palaces and daunting deserts are fitted in with precision. Deepika is breathtaking and in top form. Ranveer displays his six packs and histrionics with fair ease. You have to also applaud Richa Chadda and Supriya Pathak Kapur for being the talent they are.  On the flip side, please note, the build up of the romance could've been better; the sale of guns in a mandi (market place) is implausible; Ishaqzaade that had a similar plot was less ostentatious but more authentic; the pathos in the relationships was missing and the last shot where Ram and Leela fall in slow-motion into the water, on straight backs, is contrived.  Ranveer Singh's 'roar' is identical to that of Ajay Devgn's in Singham. SLB's tribute to Rohit Shetty?

With trimmed hats, stilettos (higher than her dreams) or with a brazen billionaire to whisk her away into a fairytale of fantasies. She's Rajjo (Kangna), the little girl who lost her childhood in an infamous kotha, in the dingy red-light ilaakas of the city. Although, she's the Queen Bee (called Rajjo Rani) of her domain, commanding the highest rate-card.  Rajjo is a top-'notch' dancer, and even as she entices a housefull of horny, hungry, lusty men with a jhalak, jhatkas and mujras, she harbours a deep-seated dream of being a classical dancer. But before that, a Maharashtrian Virar ka chokra, the 21-year-old Chandu (Paras) walks into her kotha with his budding manhood, albeit with noble and naive intentions. Somehow, love blossoms over closed-door callow chats (purely platonic), under the supervision of Begum (Manjrekar) - the hijra and boss of the brothel. Chandu drops out of college (without a penny or plan) to rescue his Rani from the ungracious whims of fate.  Kangna, as Rajjo makes a pretty picture in every frame (perfect make-up, hair-do and fashionable clothes. Why???). You can't miss her reddened lips even as she turns into a village belle for some part. She makes a sincere effort, but is trapped in story that crumbles and finds no escape. Yet, she's the only thing that helps us sail through this tiring tragedy. Paras is passable (he's got plenty of 'growing up' to do); Manjrekar is effective and Prakash Raj needs to reinvent himself with an urgency.  Vishwas Patil probably had a heart-wrenching story, but he's unable he exploit his cast well, or narrate a tale that's coherent, consistent or engaging. Randomness rules! Events unfold - forced and futile. Dialogues with zero-impact (some laughable) find their way into this mehfil of mess. Well, the social message is good, but Rajjo's trials and tragedies don't evoke a tear of emotion or grief. Most of all, the direction, execution and music is stuck in bygone era.  This one falls many notches below expectation. And not even a Rajjo-nautch can swing it out of the red-light zone.

This time RGV's newly packaged don is of a different breed, but barely matches the ballsy bhaigiri of the original. Cut back fifteen years - when Ramu on creative Viagra, ripped open Mumbai's ominous crime diaries for cinematic consumption. Tossing us into a dark, sinister world of lawless bhais, bhaus, gangstas and guns. Ever since, he's flaunted his obsession for the inglorious D's and their doomed destinies.  Meet Satya No.2 (Puneet), donning crisp corporate casuals, rimless glasses and an attitude to match that (too blah for a budding bhai!). Hustling on, Satya takes on the challenge to undo failed formulas of past infamous dons, to create a new blueprint for the bhais in business. How? He forms a company called 'Company' (really!) and launches an invincible, intangible product called Darr. He even finds executioners to market this hot-seller, and soon 'Company' turns into the deadliest crime outfit - topping the cops' radar. Meanwhile, he weds lady-love, Chitra (Anaika) who spends more time sitting pretty and pouting, than performing.  Debutant Puneet, as an intense, brooding don, puts in effort, but it appears like a gunshot and disappears quickly. His hushed huskiness is ineffective, and he's unable to evoke any feeling of fear or fatality. He has promise, but has yet to realize it.  'Satya 2' (unlinked sequel), thrives on randomness and implausible ideas. This don is unconvincing, seeking no wrath or sympathy of the viewers. The supporting cast is too weak, and the unforgettable bhaichara, the potbellied Kallu maamas and boisterous Bhikus (of Satya fame) are sorely missed. RGV relies on his trademark camera angles, close-ups and deafening 'Satya' chants (background score) to heighten drama, but guns down the plot at the onset. Even a good hangover of the remarkable prequel might have salvaged this one.  The film reiterates, \"Company ek 'soch' hai.\" We wish RGV had put in some soch into this. Truth be told, iss film ko goli maaro, and for the sake of nostalgia, watch the original, for posterity.

It raises a finger. But then 'Good' flies too. In 'Superhero' form - Caped, masked, winged - with muscles of steel and hearts of gold. Our comic-book phirang fantasy boys have flown high as 'Supermen' in Hollywood epics for eons. In India, only one man with an audacious flight of imagination - Rakesh Roshan - has thrice-over, superbly crafted a fantastical world 'alien' to Bollywood, with our very own amazingly evocative superhero - Krrish (Hrithik).  movie  Leaping from where the prequel ended, Krishna (Hrithik) lives with his wife (Priyanka), and genius Dad, Rohit Mehra (Hrithik). In twirling black cape and mask, he hurtles across the city on heroic rescue operations, playing good hubby and doing odd jobs (as the alter ego). But his life is uproariously interrupted with the emergence of a dark and destructive world of an evil called 'Kaal' (Vivek). A maniacal villain, with special powers and a venomous will to erase inferior beings - the human race.  Kaal fuses DNA, to create an assortment of evil mutants called maanvars (manav+jaanwar) - a horned Rhinoman, red-eyed Antman, a Frogman (who gives lot of tongue) and a super-shapely chameleon Kaya (Kangna). He wants to spread a deadly virus to exterminate humanity, but Krrish uses his superpowers to save 'mankind' from the malignant 'mutakind'.  Hrithik is truly the stuff superheroes are made of. Brandishing his Greek-God looks and almighty powers. Displaying larger-than-life flair and flying shoulder-to-shoulder with any Hollywood superman. As the prosthetically pot-bellied and ageing Rohit, he is incredible. Vivek, as a physically disabled anti-hero is menacing as a 'hellboy'. His lunatic laugh and white-washed make-up make him fearfully fantastic. Priyanka is good in her limited role. Kangna in her gothic and deviously dark avatar looks stunning and pulls off an outstanding act.  With a visually riveting and emotionally engaging story, intriguing characters, sweeping VFX (unseen thus far on Indian celluloid) Rakesh Roshan's ambitious dream lives up. Yes, it's hugely inspired (by the Bats, Spideys and Wolverines of the West), but our superhero has his own 'X-factor'. Even with all the high-octane car crashes, explosions and 'animatronics', the philosophy is the force behind it all, yet, never overpowering the story.  The songs are slightly disappointing and background score (Salim-Sulaiman) is good, but unable to amp up the magnitude of the film. For sheer vision, bravado and superlative execution, this one soars to new orbits. Latch on to this cape for an exhilarating ride.

Director Ashish Tyagi sheds light on a highly relevant topic for this modern day dilemma has been plaguing our society. While all parents want their children to be successful, they do not wish to be left alone, especially in old age. Law Minister Kapil Sibbal's poems add to the message, this film attempts to send across to all those children, who are too busy to notice that their parents need them.  An elderly couple residing in Delhi (Nina Kulkarni, Darshan Jariwala) faces similar issue, when their son Ashish (Amir Dalvi), who's based in Germany for business, rarely visits them. To add to their woes, is the rise in crimes committed against senior citizens in the capital. Cut to another track, we see a four-member-gang, who is perpetually on the lookout for senior citizens, whom they can loot and then kill. Sadly, the crime track is the least effective.  Besides, the two tracks fail to blend easily. The family sub-plot is highly emotional and manages to touch your heart, thanks to Nina Kulkarni and Darshan Jariwala's heartrending performances, while the whole cop investigating the case and the criminals roaming around freely, in search of new targets or new 'mummy-papa' as they keep saying throughout the movie looks way too feeble.  Overall, an ineffective execution fails to do justice to the good intent and solid performances.

Ranveer is chasing his mama, Kukreja and his sidekicks are chasing Ranveer, don Salim bhai (Tinu Anand) is chasing Kukreja and village belle Gulabo (Kirti Kulhari), her dream of becoming a Bollywood actor. When all are not running around, they boast about Rajputana shaan and the vibrant culture of Rajasthan. Other than the property dispute, the film is also essentially about loving your family and going back to your roots.  With standup comedian Vir Das at the helm of affairs, the film certainly has it's share of good laughs, with most of the humour arising from the actors' reaction to people and situations. There are a few good one-liners as well. We especially liked the 'Pakistan toh Kashmir mein aata hai' comment, which was cleverly placed. However, don't go expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy as it's predominantly a family drama. The relationship between Ranveer and his langot-clad painter mama, who has a heart of gold, is beautifully portrayed.  Deepak Dobriyal and his sidekicks amuse you in the beginning but their gags get repetitive. Vir Das is effortlessly understated. He pulls off emotional scenes with equal ease as he does his comedy. But it's the brilliant Gulshan Grover, who steals the show with his superb presence. Rajasthan has been shot beautifully.  Much to our relief, Sooper se Ooper is unconventional and thus not cliched. It's a decent entertainer. Sadly, it's not as funny as we had expected it to be either.

It's for the overtly romantic types, who watch films, read poetry and hope to walk in the clouds. The protagonist Gia (Neha Ahuja) falls in love with the idea of love, more than anything else, which explains her inability to make up her mind when it comes to the real world. She gets engaged to Kabir (Rayo Bakhirta) but cannot stop thinking about mystery man Neil (Rajeev Khandelwal), with whom she had a fling. Kabir is practical, while Neil is as dreamy as Gia. Who is she destined to be with?  The non-linear narrative, comprising of mysterious flashbacks, keeps you guessing in spite of the sluggish pace. The film reminded us of Vicky's dilemma from Woody Allen's 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. Of course, Ishq Actually is no VCB but the background score with its instrumental flamenco guitar pieces, tries to ape the latter for sure. Even Khandelwal is seen wearing a fedora and a scarf, looking all arty a la Javier Bardem. He is the lover who prefers to walk with his lady instead of driving her around. Can you feel the love yet?  Bottom-line? It's not the story but the way its presented, that makes this film the kind you will want to watch on a lazy afternoon. Like most arty foreign films, there's a lot of nothingness going on in it so stay away if you find this boring. However, if you are as indecisive as the protagonist, it will keep you glued. Rajeev Khandelwal makes his presence felt, while the rest are mediocre.  Ishq Actually is not actually about ishq but our notions of it, so don't expect a great love story.

Barring that, the film has its heart in the right place. It manages to send out a strong message to unapproachable netas, who forget their responsibilities, the moment they acquire power. But is 'good intent' enough for a film, which hopes to bring about a revolution?  News of cops refusing to lodge an FIR, politicians making deceptive speeches to the poor for votes, helpless cops blindly following orders...the issues raised here are valid but the execution is immature.  A little insensitivity could be forgiven, provided the dialogues are sensible and realistic. Over-exaggerated lines like, \"Journalism ek fearless job hai, sab pimp hai, usne rape kiya kaise hoga'makes it all look like a joke. Performances are decent, while the sloppy production value lessens the impact of a story which ideally had potential.  The biggest drawback of this socio-political drama is the fact that we do not find ourselves sympathising with the characters. They do not motivate us enough to speak up either. The film has a deeper message to it than condemning rape and rapists. It keeps us guessing. Sadly, this whole 'common man's struggle' comes across as too simple a fight and thus unconvincing.

You can fight terrorism. But what happens when you are branded a 'Terrorist' for life? On the grounds that your name reads 'Zahir', 'Faheem', 'Khan', 'Shaikh' (and not Matthew or Donald? God help!).  movie  Even if you're acquitted, the right to live a life in fairness and dignity is permanently adjourned. Case closed! The story of 'Shahid' (fact remixed with fiction) confronts us with hard-hitting questions on religious fundamentalism, flawed legal investigations, and injustices suffered by the underdogs.  In his teens, Shahid (Raj Kumar) witnesses the savagery of religious antagonism during the 1993 Mumbai riots. Shattered and shaken, he escapes from his 'slumdog' existence to Kashmir to join the militants. Unnerved with lessons in jihad and jingoism, he returns to a brief life of normalcy in Mumbai.  The past catches up. He's arrested and thrown into prison under Mumbai's anti-terror laws. During his term he meets co-quaidi and mentor who shows him light in the dark cells of his tormented existence. Shahid begins studying in jail, once acquitted, he gets his law degree and amidst much resentment, humiliation (often called jihadiyon ka Gandhi) and life-threatening challenges, he becomes a fearless champion for his cause. He remarkably wins some of the most controversial terrorism cases (including defending the prime accused in 2008 Mumbai terror attack). One fateful night Shahid is gunned down. His case files reopen.  Mehta's film is brutally honest, brave and above all a fascinating humane story. Nothing distracts the dark and disturbing subject, the narrative is not found guilty of over-dramatizations; indulgence or loaded lines (like 'tareek pe tareek' and 'Milord', here). He finds a perfect pitch at crucial points - The courtroom interrogations, Shahid's subtle romance with Mariam (Prabhleen), and moments shared with Arifbhai (Mohammed, in a fine performance) are subtle, but stirring.  Raj Kumar is superb; he peels layers to strip to the core of his character. He magnifies the most intense scenes with sheer brilliance of an understated, realistic performance. It warrants applause. And an unadulterated encore. Catch it if real cinema is what you crave.

If you rephrase it a little with 'Apne ko toh bus Akshay Kumar ka stunts dekhna hai', then Boss is a 'kick-ass' entertainer. After all, we all know who the Boss of action in Bollywood is.  movie  A remake of 2010 Malayalam film, Pokkiri Raja, Boss is a formulaic action comedy. There are truckloads of stunts throughout and whatever falls in between constitutes the plot so don't expect logic. It seems the action was probably chalked out before and the 70's-like melodramatic story was inserted later as filler, which explains why most characters end up being silent spectators, once Akshay makes an entry. The very vicious ACP Ayushman Thakur (Ronit Roy, brilliant) in particular gets easily outplayed by our Haryanvi hero. The romantic track between Shiv Pandit and Aditi Rao Hydari is terribly inconsequential.  To cut a long story short, Boss solely relies on Akshay's star power and he carries the film on his shoulders with aplomb. It's his dialoguebazi and filmygiri that make you smile, no matter how corny the one-liners. He climbs the walls at a lightning speed like a Spiderman, jumps over rooftops, trucks and makes his way in a crowded place by walking over the heads of his enemies. He makes gravity-defying stunts look believable. We particularly liked this elaborate chase sequence which looks like it's been shot in one-take. From cracking of bones to the crunching of chanas that the villain munches on, the sound effects add to the intensity of the slow-mo stunt scenes.  Mithun Chakraborty goes overboard with his preachy Nirupa Roy-esque character and is thus unintentionally funny. Ronit Roy has a superb presence. Sadly, he gets meagre footage.

Sadly, there is no comedy or entertainment either, and for a film that intends to be funny, this one ends up being tardy and way too predictable for your liking.  A successful author (Ali Fazal) pretends to be a geek in order to impress his girlfriend's (Alisa) brother (Gulshan Grover), because he expects his brother-in-law to be intelligent. That somehow implies that writers are not intelligent. Anyway, while the hero's almost on the verge of winning over his girl's bhaiya, his rowdie lookalike shows up, adding to the drama. That's not all. Even the bhaiya has a lookalike! Will things fall into place?  The major issue with this movie is the fact that it borrows heavily from films like Chupke Chupke, Golmaal and Seeta Aur Geeta. Even if we ignore the lack of originality, the formula that worked in the 1970's looks way too outdated for today. Besides, those films had a solid script and some great comic timing. Here, barring Gulshan Grover, everyone else looks like they are trying too hard to make you laugh. Not their mistake. Blame it on the poor writing.  What disturbed us the most were the terrible sound effects (e.g., toilet flush sounds) which hound you throughout the film. That's another reason why the film puts you off. In a desperate bid to entertain the audience, we are bombarded with these fake and supposedly funny noises throughout.  Razzak Khan looks disinterested in the film while the heroine and her sister-in-law are made to look plain silly. Ali Fazal rises above the writing but eventually, the film lets him down.

TV reporter Rut Dutta (Soha Ali Khan) promptly reaches the LOC to cover the notified attack LIVE! Raj (Sharman Joshi), captain of the Indian army, happily shows her around, unlike a brooding Shah Rukh Khan of Jab Tak Hai Jaan. When the two are not busy ogling each other, they play antakshari with Qureshi (Javed Jafferi), captain of the Pakistan army and his soldiers! Rut soon discovers that rival soldiers are caught in banter with each other instead of crossfire. Does this camaraderie help in sustaining peace between the two countries? Will it expose the hidden agendas of the US and China?  Promoted as India's first war comedy, one must acknowledge filmmaker Faraz Haider for deviating from 'formula films' and offering something new. His concept is unique. After all, how many films have revolved around the cross-border equation between Indian and Pakistani soldiers till date?  Black comedy is a rare genre in Bollywood and hats off to Haider for bringing it to the forefront. His subject is relevant, given the many unpleasant cross-border incidents that have occurred of late.  Unfortunately, a poor script and juvenile execution let the promising premise down. After a while, the characters start looking caricaturish, especially the 'forever meat-hungry' Pakistani army. A few genuine one-liners do evoke laughter. (e.g., US selling guns to India on EMI). However, repeating the same jokes over and over again spoils the fun.  Also, the events seem way too convenient, implausible and far-fetched for one's liking, given the sensitivity of the situation. We understand it's a comedy and so the wishful thinking, but a little authenticity would have helped. Also, why the cliches? Making media and politicians the butt of all jokes has been done to death.  There's an underlying tragedy that lies at the heart of this film but it gets overshadowed by too many childish gags. While Sharman, Soha and Javed are perfectly understated, Dalip Tahil goes overboard with his various impersonations.

He can change your mood with a flick of an emotion. Laughter, tears, joy and palang tod romeo-giri. Bedazzling the eyes with baubles, goggles and padded crotches. Yes, he packs in this 'bulge' with besharmi and fearlessness.  movie  At the outset, let me tell you that Kashyap's ('Dabangg' fame) 'Besharam' lacks a kadak story. It has thoda herogiri, clap-trap dialogues, freestyle rowdy dancing and stylish stunts (borrowed from recent action films). Bas! But RK drives this one (taking fuel and pee breaks) through fast freeways and rocky roads.  Babli (Ranbir), a baap-less boy, is a car mechanic-cum-thief, with braveheart. Along with his partner-in-crime, Titu (Amitosh Nagpal), they steal cars to support the orphanage that housed them. The smooth operators have a touch of class too, they dress like MIB ('Men In Black') call themselves T1 & T2 ('Terminator').  During one carnama, they encounter the comical cop-couple, Chulbul (Rishi) and Bulbul (Neetu) Chautala. Enter Tara (Pallavi), the 'beauttee' he falls for. He breaks her heart and spends the rest of the film fixing dils and dents.  This seems like Kashyap's test-drive with Ranbir, with average direction, un-moving music, and a screenplay that is unoriginal and so low on horsepower that it deflates before he revs the reel. He relies on the sheer 3K (read"},{"Name":"Prague","Release Time":"Apr 26 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Chandan Roy Sanyal, Arfi Lamba, Kumar Mayank, Elena Kazan","Director":"Ashish R. Shukla","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 50 minutes","Review":" If you are the type who looks for reasons and answers in a story, Prague is not for you. It doesn't have an agenda, per se, nor is it easy to comprehend. It's free-floating, erratic, pensive and sombre, just like its protagonist's mind.  The mood is kept melancholic as the camera follows an architect (Chandan Roy Sanyal) who keeps wandering around, attending to his random thoughts. More than a conversation, his every dialogue is him thinking aloud. The dark, non-linear storytelling helps build a psychological tension throughout, making you feel as if you are being sucked into a black hole, with no way out. If you are patient enough to appreciate and observe the intricacies of Chandan's behaviour, Prague won't disappoint you.  What we particularly liked about the film was its layering. The film is structured beautifully. It's atmospheric, unique and manages to hold your attention with its abstract imagery. However, for the impatient ones, finding method in the lead character's madness could get painful, especially since the film is a tad confused and sluggish. A few lines could also offend women. What particularly made us cringe was a 'casual scene', where a guy asks a girl to pronounce the Hindi word for thigh.  Performances and cinematography are impressive. The Czech capital has been captured beautifully and so are romantic glances and flirtatious advances. Chandan Roy Sanyal is impactful and the very pleasant Elena Kazan makes her presence felt.  More than the city, Prague, the film, is about Chandan's psychological struggle, haunting past and inconsistent behaviour. It's not for everyone. However, if you prefer unconventional, mysterious drama over mainstream entertainment, Prague will engage you.

If it doesn't give you a throbbing headache, you deserve a medal for putting up with utter crap in the name of cinema. The film is loaded with terrible dubbing, out of focus scenes, sleazy songs, tacky dialogues, horrible outfits, a dumb story and pathetic direction.  If you must know the story - Sonia (Sweta Bharadwaj) is an actress who adopts her niece Suhani (Sheena Shahabadi), as her mother dies in an accident. Sonia adores Suhani but the latter fears if Sonia falls in love with anyone else, she might send her away to a boarding school. In no mood to share her mother's affection, she kills everyone who comes between them.  Strangely, the mother has no clue about the happenings and is not suspicious of her daughter's behaviour. Thus, many more get killed and the film goes on forever, leading to nowhere.  Almost everything about the film is annoying and appalling at the same time. The mother-daughter bond looks like a joke. Farida Jalal plays the role of a maid and because she happens to be 'Maria', she speaks in that cliched Bollywood Christianised-Hindi. \"Tum karne ko mangta, bachcha baby, bada baby.\"  \"You know how it works in Hollywood\" tells a director to an actress, a woman shows off her cleavage and says, \"Objects are bigger from inside than they appear outside\", etc. There is also this cringeworthy 'lesbian' scene which grosses you out. Shakti Kapoor plays the role of a noble priest and that evokes laughter for obvious reasons. Performances are as lame.  Avoid at all costs!

With their complex love stories, ex-affairs, phobias and fears. All trying to find an anchor, submerged neck-deep in water. Estranged school-friends reunite in Fiji (yet again) on a yatch, supposedly owned by Bakshi (Santosh), the one amongst them who seems to have lived life king-size. Jeanine (Suzana) is his hot-pot gal gal who makes a sexy bare-back entry.  Anshul (Varun), the dost with the most (size-wise) is also the most loved of 'em all. Sabina (Manjari), the school phataka-turned hot-momma joins with hubby (Jitin) and baby onboard. Aman (Sumit) is the rich spoilt brat who drifts without ambition. Gunjan (Madhurima) is the gutsy go-getter(with a hot- bod). The buddies set sail in calm waters, but soon their sweet soiree meets with a tumultuous turn.  They all throw 'warning to the wind' and dive in for a swim, but are unable to re-board because of one incautious move. The film embarks on an underwater adventure, but shows as much emotional undercurrent. The characters tide through their past tragedies and heart-breaks, even while sharks attack and their hopes sink in deep waters.  If you suffer from hydrophobia, be warned that this story won't keep you buoyant for long. The characters stay in water for most part and all the dramatic deluge happens deep down. The continuous sea shots do make you sea-sick, washing away your attention span. Some off-shore action would have kept the story afloat longer.  The 3D-effects kick in at the beginning, and come in spurts later, missing the real 'high tide' moments where it was much needed. There are some well-crafted underwater scenes and few moments which take you to the emotional deep-end. The performances (neck-above) are decent, but can't prevent turbulence at the story-level.  'Warning', heavily inspired from Hollywood film 'Open Water 2' with all its highs and lows is a new effort at a waterworld story, but fails to safely swim ashore even with a life-vest.

The beaches of Fiji. Five women in their itsy-bitsies, flashing plenty of ti**sy. A hotshot fashion photographer. And a coveted Super Model title up for grabs. One would think this is the ideal setting for a story sunwashed in sex and sin, with slow-mo shots of Baywatch babes lapping the lenses. Alas, it's not!  The otherwise fabulous Fiji looks anything but that. The fashion-photog is a bare-bodied bronze beach-boy who captures no part of your attention. The wannabe models in terrible two-pieces and blurred cleavages are pancaked and passionless. So, while the director went sunbathing, this is what happened on the runway.  Dev Walia (Chayya) assigns top fashion photographer Monty (Ashmit) to find a super model for his next calendar shoot. He selects a bunch of desperate damsels for a photo-shoot in Fiji (Viola! We soon realize it's a competition!). One of them is Rupali (Veena), fondly called Roops (should be Oops, really!). She bats her fake lashes and Monty quickly falls for her, while the rest of the Rosys, Monas, Bobbys are clueless in their cat fights; getting cozy on chandni nights.  There's an angle of whodunit (well, the whole point of the film is a mystery) and a brave attempt at humour with two characters called Taka Tak (WTF!). And of course, Jaggu dada (Jackie Shroff) in a cameo, who starts narrating the story, but abandons it halfway (sightseeing, perhaps?).  The film reminds you of a popular voyeuristic television show, albeit a downgraded version. With trashy production values (There's a shot where a mike strapped to a model's back is visible. OMG!), a futile story, cheesy dialogues (Sample this shocker"},{"Name":"Maazii","Release Time":"Apr 26 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Sumeet Nijhawan, Mona Wasu, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Pankaj Tripathi","Director":"Jaideep Chopra","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 1 minute","Review":" Florist Tarun (Sumeet Nijhawan), his wife Srishti (Mona Wasu) and their little daughter live happily in the beautiful hills of Mussoorie. While Tarun is calm as a cucumber, Srishti is vivacious and dominating. Their idyllic life however gets a sudden jolt when Tarun ends up confronting two criminals who misbehave in his shop. The repercussions of that event put his and his family's life in jeopardy, also bringing to the forefront some startling revelations and brutal confessions.  It's commendable that debutant director Jaideep Chopra delivers a spine-chilling thriller that has an international sensibility and feel to it. The film starts brilliantly. Major credit goes to actor Pankaj Tripathi for creating that psychological tension, an underlying air of somberness, through his eerie prologue.  The film then shifts gear. The tension mellows. A happy 'family track' grabs our attention before we are transported back to the unveiling of a mystery. The 'whodunnit' thriller keeps you engaged throughout.  Performances and cinematography are impressive and so is the story-telling. Nowhere does the film slow down or lose momentum. What we didn't like were a few irrelevant sub-plots and characters. The item song could have been easily avoided too. The bloodshed and violence start getting predictable and formulaic after a while. The portrayal of the media in the film is silly. The film also seems to be partially inspired by Hollywood film Taken.  Overall, Maazii is a dark, haunting and unconventional tale of crime and redemption. In spite of no big names associated with it, it manages to hold your attention till the end.

First, his own starry dreams (ruled by Rajnikanths and Khans) of being a Bollywood superstar. Second, his high-on-melodrama maa's (Padmini) long cherished dream - \"mera beta police afsar banega\". But fate takes a hilarious twist when he's mistaken for a good cop (Thank Heavens, he has Chulbul Pandey for inspiration. With tighties, googles, dabanggisms, and his own sizzling 'Munni'). He falls in love with the over-zealous Kajal (Ileana), a social worker with many chaotic-causes. Soon he's caught in chor-police crossfire between the dreadfully funny gangster Gundappa Das (Saurabh Shukla) and the asli good cop (Darshan Jariwala) - both put up rip-roaring acts. In a comedy of errors and events, through heartbreak and hilarity, emotion and eccentricity, Vishwas flips between fake herogiri and asli heroism.  movie  Shahid is 'phaadu', really! Whether he's doing the dhating naach (outstanding); playing rowdy Romeo, a goofy goon, or maa ka laadla; he's back in form and packs in all with terrific chutzpah and comic flair. He makes the most of every 'emoticon' there is and leaves you 'ROTFL'. This one belongs to Kapoor and he revels in it.  Ileana is good at emotions, but not so tuned into comedy yet. Padmini, the melancholic maa with tons of mascara plays the part with ease, though we wish she induced more laughs over tear-jerking 'maa-kasam' dialogues. Sanjay Mishra, as Vishwas' Bollywood advisor is uproariously funny.  Santoshi shows flashes of his previous 'Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani', odes to his own classics ('Andaz Apna Apna', 'Ghayal') and of course the ultimate fan-boy moment when Vishwas meets his screen idol Salman (the asli hero!). The first half offers loads of cackles, chuckles, witticisms and spoofy scenes. Post-interval the comedy collapses for a bit with forced OTT drama, khaali-peeli action, and too many songs breaks, but makes a comeback with delightfully funny moments.  This one's worth it for the 'howlarity' of it all. And Shahid in his element. 'Vishwas' nahin hota? ...Go watch! (LOL! Maa Kasam, it's just the comedy hangover!)

It is the story of a suburban housewife, deeply alone. It is the story of meeting via eating. It is a love-story - and a love-letter to Mumbai, to trains that go dhak-dhak, to dabbawalas and rain, to love and life, sugar and spice, the despair and hope that mark every heart.  movie  Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan) is an accountant. His wife having died, the childless Saajan is a cold, prickly grouch avoided by all. One day, a lunchbox prepared by Ila (Nimrat) for her husband somehow reaches Saajan instead. He devours her delicacies, the empty box returned evidence of his enjoyment. Annoyed by the stranger's lack of thanks, Ila sends him another lunchbox with a sarcastic note - he responds. Suddenly, the two are writing daily, sharing jokes, fears, passions for keema and kadhi - then, a desire to meet.  This movie is held together by delicate performances. Irrfan leads the way, underplayed, yet lasting, like a cardamom between your lips. With moments like Fernandes catching himself in a street painter's sketch, Irrfan shows an ordinary life with extraordinary deftness, resurrecting that childhood uncle, who, begged to return your ball, would snarl, \"Do I look like your servant?\"  Irrfan is matched by Nimrat's Ila, soft as a sandesh, but with a mysterious, molten heart. Quiet moments, like Nimrat's expression when she smells the world on her husband's shirts, catch you. Ila's story, housewives living for husbands who switch off, is beautifully conveyed. The two are ably supported by chirpy, pesky Shaikh (Nawazuddin), Saajan's trainee, chopping vegetables on office files, melting the final barriers to Fernandes' frozen heart.  Warming this feast is a wonderful screenplay - Bharti Achrekar, visible in voice as 'Aunty' - and sound recording that must be heard to be believed. As Fernandes eats Ila's lunches, every lick, every slurp, every little swallow comes through. Its finesse qualifies this charmer as India's potential entry to the Oscars, The Lunchbox an unusual banquet, raising a bitter-sweet toast to life.

They are intrigued by stories of mysterious deaths occurring in its seemingly haunted room No. 3046. A Ramu-kaka like waiter even warns, \"Jis din bhuton pe vishwas karoge, us din zinda nahi bachoge.' The group pays no heed. They enter the property, hoping to debunk paranormal occurrences. What do they discover?  Friends, haunted mansions and eerie nights make for spine-chilling horror films. The makers have all the right ingredients to scare the living daylights out of you. But instead of utilising the classic setting differently, they borrow heavily from Hollywood films (1408, Mirrors, The Ring).  Cliched paranormal happenings, like a door shutting by itself, characters exploring the hotel solo, in spite of knowing they are most likely to get killed when alone, etc., get frustrating to watch as the dim-witted script makes the characters look daft.  Real fear evokes deadly silence and not screams. Remember that spectacular scene in Ram Gopal Varma's Bhoot when Urmila Matondkar is left speechless with fear on spotting the ghost for the first time? A few scenes capable of being real spooky here are marred by the characters' incessant blabbering. For a genre like this, it's terribly distracting. You get sick of listening to 'Come on guys, we will survive guys, what is happening guys', et al. None of the 'guys' are however worried about being caught for trespassing!  Barring a scene, where you see an empty wheelchair moving around the hotel corridors, the rest fails to send shivers down your spine. You get bored of the running around. With no major scares, the film gets tedious and even 90 minutes seem like never-ending. The back story of the ghost is equally lame. The performances and cinematography are not effective either.  We like Vikram Bhatt's brand of horror but this Horror Story was more silly than scary.

John suspects foul play when years later, his wife faces a similar fate. The mysterious tragedies ignite his quest for truth and vengeance. Turns out, John is a pawn in a bigger conspiracy that involves gum-chewing-gun-wielding, bad-ass cop Gautam (Randeep Hooda).  movie  Volatile and temperamental, Gautam has his own obscure motives. While he isn't intimidated by death, he's enslaved by the past. The two, in their pursuit of redemption and retribution, get embroiled in a vicious game of cat and mouse.  John Day, a rip-off of Spanish thriller Box 507, is dark, edgy and brooding thanks to the execution and background score. The debutante director manages to create a mood of suspense as he keeps things unpredictable, especially towards the beginning. However, as the film progresses, the pace drops, scenes look repetitive and the story gets so convoluted that you lose track of characters and their motives.  Also, the film is loaded with random brutal violence (you see Hooda biting a goon's tongue and ripping it out) and incessant swearing...if you can't digest blood, gore and profanities, better stay away. Wonder if this was an attempt at making the film look borderline art-house.  Randeep Hooda keeps his clenched-jaw look constant, thus making his menacing presence felt. We'd like to see more variation in his choice of roles though. Naseeruddin Shah exudes the inner turmoil of his character with utmost conviction. Pity he gets lost in the web of events that fail to make sense. Shernaz Patel is effective in her small but significant role. As Randeep's alcoholic and masochist girlfriend, Elena Kazan fits the bill.  John Day initially gives an impression that it's all about decoding a puzzle or unravelling a mystery at breakneck speed. Unfortunately, that's not the case. It's gripping but like the characters, the plot is way too ambiguous, deceitful and tedious for your liking.

It steps out from behind the bloomin' trees in tulip fields and comfortably 'shacks-up' with the times. Here 'smooch-at-first-sight' happens in a bus-full with baaratis. Coffee dates are sipped in bed (Happy Endings? Huh!). Commitment is not the criteria. Marriage is not on the cards. And sexual compatibility is high priority. Yes, welcome to a modern day shuddh romance in desiland. Plenty 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang', tucked in with some emotion and drama too.  movie  Raghu-(Sushant)-the-Romeo is a tourist guide in Jaipur, who also doubles up as rental baraati for Goyal (Rishi), a shaadi planner. He meets the rebellious Gayatri (Parineeti) and feels a \"tezwala\" attraction towards her. They waste no time in moving in, and making out. Soon, they're love-addicts, but commitment-phobic. The third character in this threesome (don't expect any of that) is Tara (Vaani), who was supposed to wed Raghu, until he fled on his wedding day. She makes a re-entry for revenge, but ends up with a complicated status, really.  Sushant swings between the Patiala-clad women and makes for the perfectly confused, charming and lovable Romeo. His hair perfectly styled at all times (though he should have had the 'out-of-bed' look more often), his clothes are more designer than dehati, but he more than makes up for it with his desi cool performance.  Parineeti is a phataka, firing dialogues (smoking up too) and living it up. She makes the character her own, complementing Sushant with a casualness that's commendable. Newbie Vaani is impressive, pretty and commands a good screen-presence. Rishi Kapoor, blows you away yet again with his incredible histrionics.  Maneesh Sharma's 'SDR' has a 'Band Bajaa Baraat' blend, but the essence lies in the conversational chemistry between the characters, some beautifully captured moments and slice-of-life scenes. He doesn't play safe, which is good, but the second half seems repetitive. The concept is engaging, but the plot is little shuddh, little desi and quite confused.

The original film earned Amitabh Bachchan the epithet 'angry young man' and made him world-famous. The 2013 action thriller brings Andhra icon Chiranjeevi's son, Ram Charan (also an Andhra superstar) to Bollywood. It retains the key plot points and the main characters are rechristened Vijay (Ram Charan), Mala (Priyanka Chopra), Sher Khan (Sanjay Dutt), Teja (Prakash Raj) and Mona (Mahie Gill) just like the original.  movie  Yet, this film should be judged as a stand-alone offering because attempts to compare the two versions will find the current one falling short, especially in the dialogue and music departments. Nostalgia happens when some original dialogue like 'Yeh police station hai, tere baap ka ghar nahi' and 'Sher Khan beimaani ka dhanda bhi imaandari se karta hai' are uttered.  To reprise the plot, Zanjeer is the story of an idealistic cop, Vijay Khanna, wanting to bring criminals to the book. Set in Andhra Pradesh, the initial part sets the stage for how dons and ministers have more clout with and within the administration, than an honest policeman. As a result, Vijay is transferred 17 times within AP. In his 18th assignment in Mumbai, this Assistant Commissioner of Police takes on an oil mafia don, Teja (Prakash Raj).  Teja fails to strike fear, playing something between Al Capone (Untouchables) and a buffoon. Anyway, whistleblowers are set on fire and uninhibited killings happen on Mumbai streets, making it seem as if the entire khaki force (except Vijay) is asleep. The climax, shot against the backdrop of a Moharram procession, is interesting.  Ram Charan, as the brooding policeman, excels in action. His dark eyes with long lashes adeptly convey anger. Sanjay Dutt is competent and lovable. Priyanka looks smashing but is overzealous in the American Born Desi Gujarati Girl act. Mahie Gill as the gangster's girl Mona is raunchy.

Vibrantly layered, Satyagraha weaves together urban legends of corruption, encompassing corporate lobbyists to murdered engineers. It features slices of histories, Chauri Chaura, Mandal, Anna Hazare's Jan Lokpal Andolan. It takes a real issue - corruption - to reel life, movingly fusing fact with fiction, leading to a security guard accompanying a politico at its screening to sing out aloud, \"Aam aadmi kitna aam, Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram...\"  movie  Retired teacher Dwarka Anand (Bachchan) is an idealistic man. His engineer son Akhilesh's buddy Manav (Devgn) is an ambitious capitalist. Manav cherishes his friend - who suddenly dies. Minister Balram Singh (Bajpai) announces compensation which Akhilesh's wife Sumitra (Rao) cannot get despite daily applications before government babus. Incensed, Dwarka slaps an arrogant official and gets imprisoned. Manav starts a campaign to free him, using social media, roping in wannabe-bahubali Arjun Singh (Rampal) and journalist Yasmin (Kapoor). As hopeful students, hungry labourers and angry middle class citizens join, politicians panic. Will their moves derail the movement?  Devgn is Satyagraha's strong body while Amitabh - gaunt in grief, moving in fortitude - is its soul. And Bajpai is its glittering, malevolent cloak, delivering a satiny performance hair-raising in its perfection. Bachchan voices the movie's philosophy - \"Janta sarkaar ki malik hai. Malik nirdesh deta hai. Maang nahin karta.\" But what is the best way to give such nirdesh? Symbolic protest? Violent revolt? Or a longer, harder route?  Satyagraha grapples with this dilemma. More philosophical than fiery, it adorns reality with gloss and loss. Dwarka touching the earth where his son fell brings tears while Prasoon Joshi's wonderful lyrics - \"Uthkar karne hain kuch kaam, Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram\" - bring hope.  Satyagraha deserves an extra half-star for capturing corruption from root to branch - a government babu complains, \"Yahan toh table ka bhi bhaada dena padta hai\". Showing true Satyagraha has no short-cuts, it also shows solutions glimmering ahead, as ephemeral, yet powerful as a rainbow cleansing the dust.

His take on caste, religion, God, family, marriage, social work and well-being of his country and people forms the story. His devotion for Swami Ramakrishna is also an integral part of the film.

Political, tense, finally explosive, Madras Cafe is no picnic in the neighborhood park. Major Vikram Singh (Abraham) lands in Sri Lanka, heading RAW's covert operations. He must work with colleague Bala to get Anna Bhaskaran (Rathnam), head of the rebel LTF group - \"Also known as Tigers\" - to accept a peaceful resolution. Vikram knows Anna will be a huge challenge - what surprises him is how many others he must face.  movie  Madras Cafe dives boldly into terrain Bollywood hasn't touched before. Its arsenal features research, respect and bravely, no songs. But it's not arty or preachy anywhere. Its first half is layered, complex trails - leaks, foreign interests, domestic rivals - slowly revealed to Vikram. As RAW boss Robin Dutt (Basu) ups the pressure, Vikram must move fast through sultry, dangerous airs. His foreign journalist friend Jaya (Fakhri, apparently playing real-life journalist Anita Pratap, who first interviewed LTTE chief Prabhakaran) knows this conflict's heart even better than Vikram, whose discoveries, from Sri Lanka to South Block, grow traumatic.  Madras Cafe's true star is its story which builds up to an agonizing end. It brings to life the Lankan war which many viewers were too young to have known. It highlights India's ambiguous role, moving sensitively, taking no sides, except those of relationships involving respect - but no romance - between Vikram and Jaya, duty, victory and loss. Its second half grows more fraught and taut, conspiracies and compulsions becoming clearer. John stays low-key and competent as Vikram while supporting actors, like agents Bala, SP and Vasu, stand out. Restrained performances by the LTF suicide bombers are chilling.  The cinematography is remarkable, shots of huge naval warships, helicopters floating across hills, sunshine on a deadly sea, haunting. Commendably, Sircar never overindulges in gore, keeping Madras Cafe a shifting site of mental violence. Madras Cafe deserves an extra half-star for guts, going for the gunpowder - but with a restrained hand.

In OUATIMD, a love triangle forms the bloodline of the story, replete with 'donnisms', molls with maal and an overkill of 'loaded' dialogues pe dialogues.  movie  After Shoaib (Akshay) vanquishes his own gang-guru (in the prequel), he becomes the reigning mafioso with his terror squad spreading far and wide. Of course, Mumbai city wrapped in glam, glory and blood-soaked crime files is still fancied by the bhais (\"Samundar ke baad Mumbai Shoaib se jani jaati hai!\"). Shoaib picks up young Aslam (Imran) from the chawls and takes him under his wing. Their 'bhaihood' is bullet-proof, only until years later when starlet Jasmine (Sonakshi) walks in and arrests Shoaib with her charm and gullibility. The rogue turns Romeo with obsession, but she's already Aslam's chosen 'item'. Suddenly, the dons drop their other deadly dhandas to deal with crimes of passion instead (unbelievable!).  Milan Luthria captures the essence of the period, packed with characters living behind 'dark shades' with an even darker conscience. This is a love story of a gangsta, it does not reopen dons' crime diaries. The first part is more engaging; thereon, the sluggish pace lacks the same dum. The heavy-duty dialogues (Rajat Aroraa) punch drama in the story, though at times too overbearing. The background score (Pritam & Anupam Amod) pitches in dramatically. This film has its moments, but it's not as compelling as the prequel.  Akshay does the bhai act with flamboyance and mojo. He gets a chance to do what he does best - herogiri  (albeit less menacing, more entertaining), with charisma and clap-trap dialoguebaazi. Imran looks too suave for the part, but eventually rolls up his sleeves to play a don with dil, performing well in emotional scenes. Sonakshi pulls off a dabangg act to stand strong between two daunting dons.

Never having been strong in the story department, CE too has a gullible plot line. Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) is asked by his dadi (Kamini Kaushal) to drop his granddad's ashes in Rameswaram, the southern-most tip of India. He boards the Chennai Express to hoodwink granny but has secretly planned a getaway with his guy friends to Goa. Alas, in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge fashion, a damsel in distress, Meena (Deepika Padukone) asks for his outstretched hand as he stands on the footboard. And his Samaritan act changes his destiny.  He discovers she's the daughter of a Don from a South-side village and her accompanying cousins (hulks in pony tails) want her to return home. Her father wants Meena to marry another hulk (Niketan Dheer) from a nearby village, so he can then rule two villages. Meena resists and insists to her father (Sathyaraj) that it is Rahul who has her fancy. The father relents but the other hulks resist.  From here on, Rahul constantly tries to outsmart the South Indian mob. And as expected in Indian mainstream cinema, he breaks into song-and-dance, gets drunk, blows up jeeps and does a Jim Carryish over-the-top act to get guffaws from a captive audience.  For what is primarily a Hindi film, there's too much spoken Tamil. There are cleverly written lines that ask you not to underestimate the south because it even plays a crucial role in the coalition government, but for the rest of India, a lot of the dialogue is lost in translation. Subtitles would be in order.  After Cocktail and Yeh Jaawani Hai Deeewani, Deepika is once again in superlative form. Shah Rukh's attempts at comedy go from convincing to convoluted. But, for the most part, he lights up the screen with his effervescence.

He chooses to be dressed as a huge samosa instead, outside a food stall. The situation gets wacky as he is also lured by Amol (Jagat Rawat), another self-proclaimed crook. The latter is forever on a mission to poach Shuklaji's loyal men to form his own gang, so that he can commit bigger crimes. Then there's a cop, who considers robbery an art and thus thieves as artists! Can it get any crazier?  Chor Chor Super Chor is a light-hearted, delightful film with a unique storyline and a superb twist. Set in Delhi, it is not an out-an-out entertainer, but manages to keep you intrigued, thanks to its quirky, innovative concept. Since the film's running time is under two hours, the length is just perfect and nowhere does it drag. The romance between Satbir and Neena is interesting. Their song seems a bit abrupt though.  However, what limits the film from being a hardcore comedy is its inability to deliver laugh-out-loud moments. You don't see yourself laughing heartily throughout the movie, except for a scene where an overweight thug gasps for breath after having to climb a tall under-construction building, which happens to be his boss' adda.  Deepak Dobriyal is impressive as usual. Priya Bhatija is pleasant. Even the supporting actors do a good job. We hate to give away the twist but let us tell you, Chor Chor Super Chor could also be titled Tu Sher Toh Main Sawa Sher as that's what the film is all about. Don't go expecting a solid comedy and you won't be disappointed.

Bhonsle","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Can cultural activities or treating criminals with respect bring about a change in their behaviour and mindset? V. Shantaram, one of our finest filmmakers, made a heart-rending film addressing this issue, way back in 1957, in Do Aankhen Baarah Haath. In spite of it being made in the '50s, it was far more impactful and thought-provoking.  While Calapor starts off well, it loses grip in no time and ends up being uninspiring and inconsequential. Major flaw being, it all looks very convenient. The notorious prisoners look noble and funny enough to pass for clowns in a circus, even before Kathak dancers Jyotsna (Rituparna Sengupta) and Ragini (Binni Sharma) enter the Central Jail in Calapor, Goa with an intention of reforming these dangerous convicts.  The inmates are co-operative, but Jyotsna is reluctant about the initiative, as for her, accepting the assignment would be reopening old wounds. She takes up the challenge nevertheless, but gets haunted by her troubled past.  What begins as a film made to address an issue transforms into a tragic family drama, where fate unites father, son and mother after years. This track, coupled with scenes of a corrupt politician and his vicious motives, hold no relevance to the film's primary theme. The suspense factor falls flat as you predict what's going to happen next pretty easily.  Humour seems juvenile and forced. Some scenes even defy logic. For instance, why would a cop himself scream 'Police ko bulao' when asking for assistance! Most actors ham endlessly, barring Rituparna Sengupta and Harsh Chhaya, who deliver fine performances. Raghuveer Yadav and Priyanshu Chatterjee are wasted.  The intent is good and we get the message, but shoddy execution fails to elicit a response or provoke sympathy for convicts who may want to change their lives for the better. A topic as significant and intense as this should have been handled better.

It's going to be one erotic escapade - kinky, caustic, brutal and brave. With ample 'O's and 'Ahhs!' Some painfully fake, others carnally climaxed. Adapted from Mohan Sikka's short story, 'Railway Aunty', it's about the doom and desperation of an impoverished life and the extremes one can go to redeem themselves of an ignominious existence.  movie  The orphaned and penniless Mukesh (Shadab) moves to Delhi to live with his bua and complete his B.A degree. Deprived of love and respect, he befriends grave-digger Johnny (Dibyendu) who becomes his chess mate. Until one day he meets the fiercely flirtatious married auntyji, Sarika (Shilpa), who swiftly seduces and beds him. The one-day adultery turns into addiction, she plays sex-guru and he surrenders as sex-slave. The moods of passion and 'positions' change with shades of her lingerie and Mukesh sinks deeper into this promiscuous 'sinfest'.

And amidst this colourful backdrop, an age-old feud simmers between two powerful families - The Mishras and the Kashyaps. Mishra son, Rahul (Prateik) - a romantic at heart, (chooses girls over guns); falling madly in love with Kashyap girl Bachchi (Amrya). One tight-chumma is all it takes to win her over (shortcut Romeo, haan?). While the city bleeds with rivalry, enraged Naxals (led by Prashant Narayanan) and political powerplay - the star-crossed lovers defy all rules of bloody war and bravely take on the world. A band of characters add to this drama - Rahul's gori ex-girl (Evelyn Sharma); Teeta (Ravi Kissen - best of the pack) as Bachchi's vicious mamu; sadhu baba (Makarand Deshpande) high on crack; Mishra's lusty doosri biwi (Rajeshwari Sachdev - impressive act), and Rahul's homeboys (Amit Sial and Vineet Kumar Singh - lending strong support).  Prateik doesn't quite fit the part of a Banarasi boy in this tangled love tragedy. His accent doesn't blend in. He air-dives and leaps from terraces and 'Spidermans' his way across walls. His range of emotions remain untapped and inconsistent throughout. Debutante Amrya, as a demure damsel (while unabashedly declaring, 'hum virgin hain' - Holy Mother!), lacks the charisma for her part and ends up looking like a pretty bahu from a tele soap opera.  Manish Tiwary's 'Issaq' lacks vibe, soul or depth needed for a classic love story. With incoherent narrative, unsketched characters, wispy (sometimes embarrassing) dialogues, one good melody in the whole ditty (Issaq tera); pointless shooting (mostly in the dark), gold-plated bandooks and bombs galore - Tiwary misses every target. There are movies beautifully adapted from Shakespeare's works in the past, but none that tragically assault your creative, poetic or cinematic senses.  \"Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs ...\" - Shakespeare.

Defying Bollywood's stereotype, that popular kids in college are seldom nice, Marky is the good guy. He fancies classmate Soniyo (Neha), the ever-smiling Punjabi girl, who too is Miss Goody Two-Shoes. The two simpletons take their time to realize that the fondness is indeed love. The realization comes a bit too late, since, by then, in order to oblige her parents' wishes, Soniyo gets engaged to army man Vikram. What follows is a twist to the tale.  movie  Luv U Soniyo manages to keep things refreshingly simple and non-sexual. For instance, the heroine does not make a slow-mo, glamourous entry into college and is not skimpily clad. The hero's not cocky either. Everything is kept understated. However, the minimalism stays stagnant, making the love seem ambiguous and unconvincing eventually. While Soniyo confesses she is clueless about love, you too feel clueless about the 'exact equation' between the lead characters. Are they lovers or friends, you keep wondering!  Like romance, humour too seems forced. Laughs don't come easy, barring the scenes where you see Aamir Khan being mimicked. Funny man Suresh Menon's cameo, as the deadly criminal Kutti, fails to entertain. The film also seems like a mishmash of various films...you see glimpses of Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and even Dil Toh Pagal Hai.  While both newcomers Tanuj and Neha are easy on the eyes and have potential, their characters don't match their personality or mannerisms. Child actor Aaditya Shivkumar, who plays Tanuj's younger brother Mario, is adorable. Songs are forgettable.  The film sends out a good message to youngsters like 'family comes first', 'respect your elders', etc. It has its share of sweet moments, but overall, as a rom-com, it fails to leave a mark.

Predominantly Punjabi-flavoured, the film is one of those of linear, comic capers with a slight drama that makes you smile, though the situations and characters are cliched. A businessman-thug Sabharwal (Ravi Kishan) gets a couple of his bank employees incarcerated when one of his hare-brained investment schemes goes kaput. The shamed bank manager commits suicide. And his lady accomplice goes to jail.  movie  The investors start baying for the blood of the departed banker's widow, Mummyji (Dolly Ahluwalia) and her son (Tusshar Kapoor). So the aggrieved party and a couple of their well-wishers, child actor Hussan Saad, Ranveer Sheorey and Vinay Pathak, whose wife is the other one imprisoned, and a teenager called Kabootar, make a fool-proof plan to deceive the man who is responsible for their woes.  Mummyji and gang target the various premises and businesses of Sabharwal. And the ways and means they adopt to achieve their end, makes way for comic situations. And love. Yes, Tusshar also manages to sing a duet with a wide-eyed neighbour (Vishaka Singh), who later becomes his accomplice.  Ransoms, raids and break-ins follow. The unsuspecting Sabharwal allows the gang to infiltrate his home and heart. And the action all comes together at his daughter's wedding because that's when he realises that he's been bajaoed (taken for a ride.)  A film without star-power depends largely on convincing performances. Dolly Ahluwalia, on a roll since Vicky Donor, is adept as are Ravi Kishan, Tusshar, Ranveer and Vinay.  While two of the songs are passable, an aarti based on a popular Bollywood tune and the item song - main naagin dance nachna—are paisa vasool.

The plot crackles. The acting sears. And the music flares with passion. Four Indian agents, angry and RAW, enter Pakistan to bring Iqbal Seth (Rishi Kapoor), a Dawood-like don, hated for his terrorism, home. Wali Khan (Irrfan) has married a local woman and fathered a child, but longs to find freedom from the truth and lies he lives. Irrfan amazes, switching from tender to treacherous in a flash, authentic as he calls out \"Rudar!\" to Rudra Pratap Singh (Arjun), a man of molten mysteries, introduced with a Lawrence of Arabia-like flair.  Arjun looks smashing and pulls off a competent act while Zoya (Huma) does well as a cutie-pie who can squeeze a knife real bad. Aslam (Aakash Dahiya), a gangster-turned-agent, forms the fourth wheel, but Rishi Kapoor stands out as Iqbal Seth, with his polyester-like silky malevolence, his mocking manipulations, his eyes behind red goggles, both frightened and frightening.  movie  That mirrors the plot which flips rapidly, hunters becoming the hunted, then vice-versa. Nasser, as RAW director Ashwini Rao, is convincing as an official straining at the leash while Iqbal's bhanja (Chandan Sanyal) is splendid with his simply asinine evil. A beautifully fragile Shruti Haasan plays a prostitute sheltering Rudra. Their track is short but sensual, a little lily-pool of beauty in an otherwise relentlessly harsh cinematography, where Karachi's grey, gritty and gunpowder-laced.  But this being Bollywood, the plot can't escape emotional excursions. Some - Rudra's love-life, Zoya's break-up - adds a halwa-like heaviness to this Karachi. But the second half refreshes your palate, sizzling sequences between Wali, Rudra and Iqbal Seth leaving you open-mouthed, the 'c' in this climax clearly for controversy.

In the first, Aliya (Aida) is a photographer with impaired vision. She depends on sound, touch and intuitive senses to capture images. After a corneal implant her eyesight is restored, but the sudden visual download is so domineering that Aliya finds herself overwhelmed in an unfamiliar world, losing touch with her natural instincts.  The second is an introspective debate between a monk, Maitreya (Neeraj-in an excellent performance) - who staunchly opposes use of animals for scientific research - and a young lawyer Charvaka (Vinay) who challenges Maitreya's non-violent world-view. The monk is diagnosed with an illness that requires organ transplant, but he'd rather die than sacrifice his principles.  The third is about a stock-broker, Navin (Sohum), who has survived a kidney transplant, but is shaken out of his self-consumed life when he learns all about the illicit organ trade.

A Bihari boy (Aarya Kumar), the most decent of the lot, finds love but his father wants dowry, money-minded baniya (Raj Kumar Yadav) dumps his girlfriend as he only wants to date rich girls. Often misguided, the youngsters find themselves trapped in a legal hassle. Inspector-cum-agony-aunt (Gulshan Grover) interrogates the boys and that's how the story unravels...  Boyss Toh Boyss Hain intends to focus on the college-going generation's false perception of love and its after-effects. What seems like a contemporary theme however gets marred by tacky scenes, cheesy dialogues, silly characters and unfunny jokes. Unnecessary incidents, which have no relevance to the story, further distract you. The message the filmmaker wishes to give gets hidden beneath all the junk that comprises the script.  Never do you really feel for the characters or their issues as they look forced and unnecessary. Why would an educated man, from a well-to-do family, take to being an escort to earn money! Cliches like a well-behaved girl has to undergo a makeover to attract boys, etc., are abundant. A sleazy item song, clearly added to entice front benchers, adds to the disappointment.  Raj Kumar Yadav surprisingly plays a money-minded baniya once again after Kai Po Che, though we believe this film must have been shot before it, as it looks a tad outdated. Interestingly, this too is about the 'mistakes' of his life. Immensely talented Divya Dutta is wasted. Everybody else is loud and annoyingly animated.

The two are very much in love and life is peaceful. But things are not meant to remain that way for long. His profession gets him into trouble one day, when they are asked to make a larger-than-normal batch. It is a high-risk operation that can land them all into trouble. When her husband is hauled into jail after a police raid, along with a number of other men, life turns upside down for Tara.  After floundering in penury and battling against feelings of loss and sorrow, she decides to take charge of her life and becomes aggressive. The experiences that she goes through are metaphorical for having her mettle tested. She'll hock her jewellery for cold cash and go to any lengths to survive. The message attempted to convey here is that you either stand up for yourself and risk alienation by your peers or just look the other way and do nothing. Her problems are faced by several other fellow villagers.  The film, of course, revolves around Tara and she does give it her best shot. But the performances from most of the other cast members are either unconvincing or, in an attempt to come across as earnest, are over-dramatized. The director probably wants the viewers of this film to empathise with the condition of the protagonist, given all the nasty things she goes through, but it fails. The song sequences seem mostly unnecessary and in some instances, serve as a distraction.  Films are conceived with an idea. In this case, it should probably have been left as one because its execution leaves much to be desired.

'Shor' (Neeraj) and 'Mehfuz' (Rohit) stand out in this ensemble. In the first story, Lallan (Vineet) and Meena (Ratnabali), are a couple wallowing in abject poverty in Mumbai. While she tailors clothes for survival, his joblessness turns him into an ignoble, suspicious husband. Ironically, only when the death-knells toll, they rediscover their long-lost feelings. The film is poignant and touching, with excellent performances.  'Mehfuz' looms around the alley of death. The main character (Nawazuddin) is a solitary soul dealing only with corpses. His clients inconspicuously send him bodies to burn and bury. Until one night a woman walks in to his life, bringing a sudden tinge of hope in his dark existence. In this starkly shocking role, Nawazuddin is brilliant. This one is worth a watch.  'Sujata' (Shlok), is a story of a young girl (Huma) who is harassed (sexually and mentally) by her incorrigible cousin brother (Aditya) since childhood. Every time she escapes his clutches, he hunts her down. Finally, after years of breeding anger and animosity, she's ready to seek bloody revenge. Huma excels at capturing the pain and agony of her character.  In this Bengali dark comedy, 'Audacity' (Anirban), the 13-year- old Lily (Preeti) is a rebel, highly influenced by pop-culture, much to the dislike of her dictatorial dad (Sankar). Her audacity to question his vices (drinking, gambling) leads to a minor social scandal and a family face-off. The Bong setting looks just perfect, but the story fails to create an impact.  Lastly, 'Epilogue' (Siddharth), is a dialogue-less film with two characters - One real (Arjun), the other ghost-like, seemingly unreal (Richa). It's a relationship between an estranged couple, where love and kinky intimacy turn into a cycle of possessive control and insanity, eventually ending in self-destruction. In this ambiguous story, too much is left to interpretation. Too arty for the soul!

Oh yes, the eternal metaphor 'the race of life'. We're all runners. With reason enough? A finish line to shred? Milkha Singh did. He ran his first race for ek glass doodh. And he never stopped. Untiringly. He ran because it was his religion.  'BMB' traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's Partition; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds purpose in life when romance blooms with Beero (Sonam). Joining the Indian Army, where his mentor (Malhotra) inspires him to take the big 'leap'. Thereon, Milkha just runs. Barefooted, bruised, and with the weight of a suffering soul. He goes on to break records, but faces heartbreaking defeat at the Rome Olympics(1960). He takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past and ultimately emerges a winner.  movie  Mehra is brilliant at his craft; he infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge. The movie transitions from flashback sepia tones to moods of present, without losing the grip of emotions, ever.  Cinematography is ace (Binod Pradhan); the music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) heightens the drama. Prasoon's writing is powerful, lyrics are pure poetry and emotions robustly sweep the scenes with few dialogues. While there's a lot to marvel at, a hint of the director's over-indulgence in the art, results in a long 'runtime' and prolonged scenes that distract.  Farhan is fantastic! He peeps through Milkha's core to essay this role. With an awe-inspiring body, grit and guts, he puts blood and sweat into Milkha. He races like an athlete, breaks into bhangra like a proud sardar and shows prowess of a Punjab-da-sher. In a brief role, Sonam prettily breezes through. Pavan and Divya (Singh's sister) are outstanding. Overall, 'BMB' pulsates with the storyteller's sheer passion all the way to the finish line.  While you are on-the-run, pause to watch this one.

The more their parents preach or protect them, the more they revolt and crave for that sense of unwarranted freedom. Can the change in the value system ruin the lives of these teenagers or can they still take the right decisions?  Unlike most films made on youngsters, Sixteen is refreshingly real and extremely relevant in modern times. Thankfully, there are no standard teenage-film cliches like youngsters taking to drugs or other addictions, misbehaviour, rebellious attitude towards parents, etc.  Purohit wisely addresses the issues that deserve to be mentioned. Peer pressure, relationship issues, sex, unplanned pregnancy, academic pressure, suicide, MMS scandals, surfing adult content on the net in spite of being under 18...almost all significant issues are maturely handled and presented. Nowhere do you feel too much is being served at one go. Although sluggish pace is what dampens the impact, as the filmmaker slips into an artistic mode every now and then. Casting is perfect. All the newcomers act well. Wamiqa Gabbi as Tanisha is impressive, Izabelle Leite is effective in spite of her voice being dubbed, Keith Sequeira lends that much needed subtlety to the story.

Ravikumar","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 20 minutes","Review":" If you are a fan of Rajinikanth's over-the-top action, if films like Wanted, Dabangg and Singham entertain you and if you like Sanju baba's style, Policegiri is bound to make you whistle. Clearly catering to the masses and fans of masala potboilers, this Hindi remake of Tamil blockbuster Saamy (2003) has all the right ingredients, required to appeal to its audience. It has the standard 'cop-cleansing-crime' theme, gravity defying stunts, slow-mo loud action scenes, dramatic storyline, over-dramatic dialogues, superhero-esque cop and a funny villain. Bollywood's fixation for formulaic cop films with south sensibility continues and if you don't have an issue with it, you certainly won't mind watching Policegiri.  movie  DCP Rudra Adityadevraj (Sanjay Dutt) has his own way of bringing the goons to justice. He thus takes up against bad guy Nagori Subramaniyam (Prakash Raj) who bribes cops, kills innocent people and does not fear the law. Like Salman Khan's Pandey ji, Rudra too feels for the public. He is the Robin Hood kind of cop, who helps the poor by punishing the corrupt. When he is not indulging in logic defying stunts, he romances Seher (Prachi Desai).  However, as an actor, Sanju does not ape Salman in any way. In spite of his age and not-so-fit body, Dutt manages to bring his own elements to the film. His individualistic style is what makes the film look different.  But not all is hunky-dory here. The very pretty Prachi Desai looks young enough to be Dutt's daughter. Prakash Raj gets to mouth a few funny lines but overall, his character is way too lame compared to his previous roles. The second half drags endlessly. A 'Sanju baba will be back' message sits right on top of the end credits of the film. For his fans, he already is and he does pack a punch.

The plot is an amalgamation of a story written by Vikramaditya Motwane with O' Henry's short story, The Last Leaf. It begins in Manikpur, West Bengal, in 1953.  A zamindar (Barun Chanda) dotes on his well-educated but impressionable girl, Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha). The landlord's Munim warns his master that courtesy the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950, zamindars like himself (read loyal to the British Empire) were losing their titles and prerogatives. But to no avail. The zamindar is visibly more concerned about his daughter's well-being, more so because she suffers from asthma.  movie  A suave archaeologist, Varun (Ranveer Singh), enters the village seeking permission from the landlord to dig up a mysterious civilisation buried around his temple. As work progresses, love blossoms between Pakhi and Varun. The father of the bride agrees to their union but the young couple face other hurdles. From a simple love story the film assumes the shape of a thriller.  A year later, Pakhi and Varun (the Lootera) find themselves under the same roof, in snow-capped Dalhousie under extenuating circumstances. Their relationship is volatile, vile and vulnerable. Love him she does, but deep inside, she is nursing a grudge against him for stealing her heart, breaking her father's heart and letting their trust down.  In his second outing, post-the critically acclaimed Udaan (2010), Motwane definitely shows an upward graph. He transports you to the '50s effortlessly with his vintage cars, opulent havelis, authentic costumes and terrific performances from his lead cast. Every frame is a picture postcard. Sonakshi, Barun Chanda and Ranveer need special mention. However, be suitably warned; the old-world aura and the languid pace are not for the young and restless.

He draws liberally either from other cinematic material or from headlines. His first film Aamir had many similarities to the Filipino film Cavite. His No One Killed Jessica was quite obviously taken from the Jessica Lal murder case. In his third movie outing Ghanchakkar, the director, is 'inspired' by innumerable Hollywood and UK black humour flicks.  movie  The film has an interesting premise. Sanjay Atre (Emraan Hashmi) and his Punjabi wife Neetu (Vidya Balan) have a humdrum existence. The colour in their lives comes from the loud clothes Vidya wears. Life promises change for them when Sanjay, who is an expert lock picker hooks up with small-time crooks Pandit (Rajesh Sharma) and Idris (Namit Das). The trio rob a bank. However, they cannot spend the money till the heat is off. So they give to Emraan for safe-keep. Three months later when it's time to enjoy their loot, they find themselves stranded because Emraan has suffered a partial memory loss. For the viewer, part of the fun begins here. One scene that is hilarious is when Emraan and Vidya start to make love but need to break it up because Emraan, who has a bout of amnesia, forgets where he put the condoms. The constant sparring between the couple and the bickering between the three thieves is also funny.There is an unusual climax to look forward to.  The music by Amit Trivedi deserves a mention. Lazy Lad, Allah Meherban and the title track have what it takes to get you in the mood.  Of the talent-Emraan gets his bewildered expression correct. And for fear of losing it, he keeps it going for the most part. Vidya provides a few laughs trying to ape the Punjabi stereotype. However, her act doesn't qualify for the real thing.

While fear is looming over the city, undercover police officers Eklavya Karmarkar (Suniel Shetty), Naeem Sheikh (Kay Kay Menon), Eric (Johnny Lever) and Madhav (Mahaakshay) are assigned the task of salvaging the situation. They arrest the much revered underworld don Mukhtar Memon (Zakir Hussain) and put him behind bars.  Senior officer Yugantar (Mithun Chakraborty) supervises the situation as he realizes there is more to it than meets the eye. While dissecting the root cause of the violence occurring in the city, he senses vicious motives from unexpected quarters.  Enemmy is a formulaic multi-starrer action film that manages to entertain when it comes to the depiction of raw action. The stunt scenes are well executed. It's the plot that seems a tad archaic. While the story has the potential to keep you hooked, unnecessary characters and sub-tracks weaken the intensity of the action. Your questions are left unanswered, especially when it comes to Yugantar and his convenient sixth sense. Nonetheless, the film's about the classic battle of good vs bad with a twist and it scores in that department.  Performances are impressive. The lead actors flaunt their aviators in style. They have good chemistry with each other too. The film marks Suniel Shetty's comeback to action and proves why he's still one of our best action heroes.  Kay Kay Menon is impressive as usual. Johnny Lever gets a serious role at last and he does it well. Mithun's presence adds a lot to the film, but his character could have been written better. He also shares the screen with son Mahaakshay for the first time.  If you find old-school masala action films entertaining, Enemmy may appeal to you.

Set in Benaras, in a sense, the heart of India, the first half in the vibrant city where the Ganges flows, just sweeps you off your feet with its colour and feel. The plot follows Kundan (Dhanush), a Tam-Bram settled in Benaras. A slight vagabond, he falls hopelessly in love with Zoya (Sonam Kapoor), a fairly affluent Muslim girl in his neighbourhood. And his feelings are beautifully conveyed through dialogue written by Himanshu Sharma and songs composed by Rahman.  Like an obsessed puppy, Kundan is happy to shadow Zoya from morning to night, till her parents hear of it. Naturally, they think it's preposterous for their teenage daughter to have a crazy Hindu admirer. So she is promptly `banished' to live with an aunt in another city.  movie  But the separation cannot stop Kundan's infatuation from growing wings. Taking a vow of celibacy, he waits patiently for his lady love to come home. When she returns, she talks of how she has fallen in love with another man Akram/Jaspreet (Abhay Deol), a senior at her university in Delhi. Kundan is devastated but he has a heart of gold. He more or less relents to becoming the best man at Zoya's union to Jassi. But life doesn't play out in a straight line. The various twists and turns that follow unravel a mystery.  And around this time, the chinks in the script also show. All of a sudden, Raanjhanaa seems like two different films. In the first half, it is an interesting, intense, introspective love story, where you empathise with the characters. In the second half, the love story gets diluted to make way for gobbledygook political ideology that is an irritant.  Director Aanand Rai should be credited for drawing a superlative performance from the National Award-winner Tamil superstar, Dhanush, who makes his Hindi cinema debut here. His Kundan is a gem (pun intended). Sonam Kapoor is in top form giving Zoya several shades from giggly to grey. Unfortunately, she gets covered more for her fashion than her true mettle as an actor.

However, their destiny is determined by their controversial residential address instead of their desires.  The film is apparently based on real life incidents. Fakeer's character is loosely based on Irfan Chindi, a resident of Nagpada, who reportedly became a police informer. He was stabbed to death on April 3, 2009.  Though the Mumbai underworld is used as a crucial backdrop for the film, it is essentially a tale of three friends, driven by unprovoked aggression. The Mumbai mafia becomes inconsequential as the film progresses.  While the underworld has always inspired filmmakers, films on police informers have been rare. Made with a humble budget, the film manages to showcase the dilemma of those who get caught between the cops and the gangsters. While most films in the same genre often sensationalize characters, Zubair Khan keeps it authentic. He justifies their anger, helplessness and vulnerability subtly. No time is wasted over building the characters. While it looks half-baked in the beginning, things fall into place perfectly towards the end.  Performances are effective. Ajaz Khan portrays every aspect of his character well. Sidekicks Javed Hyder and Vicky Ahuja deserve a special mention. They are brilliant. Aksshey Varma is impressive as the shrewd cop. Maarisha gets a small but significant role and she does it well.  Don't go expecting deep insights into Mumbai's dark underbelly as the film is essentially on friendship, survival and self discovery. The story is not about the rise or fall of a criminal, it's about people who dream of a better future.

The film revolves around Dr Asthana (Kay Kay Menon) a surgeon put on a pedestal because of the number of high-profile lives he has saved. Cocky Asthana rules Shekawat General Hospital with an iron hand. Things are going real smooth for the star surgeon till little Ankur Arora (Vishesh Tiwari) is wheeled into his operation theatre for an appendictis surgery. A medical procedure that should be a child's play for Asthana then becomes a nightmare because of his own negligence. Ankur's death is hushed up. And life continues like normal. Till one young conscientious intern Dr Romesh (Arjun Mathur) stumbles upon some clues. The cause of Ankur's death is then played out and Romesh makes it his business to expose the senior doctor who he had idolised but who actually turned out to be a surgeon with hands of clay.  Tatari is a winner in his choice of a subject. The story that has been researched from a true life incident does provide meaningful insights about the medical fraternity and facilities. However while the film is an eye-opener on medical skullduggery, it fails to become cutting edge cinema because the screenplay offers few surprises. And, a title that is a dead give away. Also for a dramatic film of this nature, the performances are so placid, they leave you cold. The drama that unfolds between the hospital and the court room should have definitely had more spunk and twists.

The GJs are sometimes very good - as scamster Gajodhar-turned-gentleman Prem, trying to impress Reet (Akheeva) with his knowledge of art, Bobby Deol hilariously confuses Zakir Hussain (\"Woh 'Wah Taj' wala - woh toh tabla bajata hai, na?\") with MF Hussain. Bobby then reappears as his artist-twin 'Q' - accompanied by \"Hussain sahib ki ghori, Gaja Gamini\". And there's the British lady overwhelmed by a painting, calling Mark and Spencer to come see it too.  movie  But the GJs get flattened by the PJs, which include an over-smart orangutan called Einstein, a blond Anupam Kher as astronaut-villain Joginder Armstrong, Johnny Lever and Sucheta Khanna in un-funny 'villain' suits (including an objectionable Hiroshima-Nagasaki one), Chinese warriors, Sumo wrestlers, Annu Kapoor's accent flying from London to LA via Ludhiana (he introduces Reet as \"daughter of late Lady Alizabeth Waltar Khanna\") and so many more.  Minus 30 minutes, YPD 2 could have been much funnier - and much shorter. It does have its moments - Sunny in the shower sweetly sparkles while Suit Mera Laal Rang Da will rock shaadi-season. But despite two pretty heroines, three Deols and an assortment of nutty buddies, YPD 2 frequently stumbles into blunder-land. Paramvir works for the world's most soft-hearted bank (its manager drawls, \"Cheques are better late than never,\"), Suman (Sharma) walks through Banaras in skimpier shorts and tighter push-up tops than what she wears in London, Reet stresses, \"Thaynk you sooo much!\" to everyone, while Einstein enjoys an awful 'item number'.  On the upside, a very attractive Sunny stays this movie's brave heart - but even his dhai kilo ka haath can't fully lift YPD 2. Pity, considering how cool its 3-D(eol) could be.

The film begins with Bheja sharing stories of his past girlfriends with his fiance. That's how we are transported to his college days, where we meet his haule (slow or dim-witted, we suppose) friends. They are called Bong, Dada, Paisa, Mota, etc., who will have to overcome their respective problems to make it to the rally.  The film aspires to be a light-hearted, slice-of-life youth film with guy jokes and buddy chemistry. Unfortunately, none of that is achieved. The characters lack personality. They aren't likeable enough to draw your attention to them or make you identify with them.  The film has no particular story to tell and we are fine with 'nothing-ness' as long as something keeps you amused. For almost two hours, you see uninteresting characters having insignificant conversations. The result is obviously uninspiring.  The script lacks situational humour and that's the biggest drawback. When you crack private jokes with your buddies, it's expected that others won't get it, but they must at least sound funny! Nothing amuses you about the boys who paint fake burgers on the walls and try eating them or beg for pocket money from their ex-girlfriends.  College days, impromptu parties, bike rides, canteen conversations, secret crushes...in spite of incorporating it all in the film, not a single scene touches your heart or takes you down memory lane. The gang's passion for bikes is barely visible. The boys seem more besotted with silly girls who wear terrible make-up. A rock chick keeps forcing Bheja to listen to rock music. She ends up chewing your brains more than his.  The film is as purposeless as the characters in it. The title track of the film, where you see the friends taking off on their bikes to celebrate their freedom, is probably the only good thing about this amateurish film.

An alive, fresh vibe dominates Ayan Mukerji's Yeh Jaawani Hai Deewani invigorating you through it's entire run. The story is not novel, but the treatment is A-grade.  Ranbir Kapoor(Kabir Thapa aka Bunny), Deepika Padukone (Naina), Kalki Koechlin (Aditi) and Aditya Roy Kapur (Avi) go on a trek. While Bunny, Aditi and Avi have always been close, Naina, the staid, studious girl is a last minute addition to the group. The group just wants to live life king-size. Early enough in the film, Bunny announces—marriage at 25, children at 30, retirement at 50 and then waiting for death—is not how he sees his life playing out. He wants to travel the world, he wants to be free. Aditi and Avi share his thinking to a degree. But Naina is different. She is studying to be a doctor, believes in family and is a rooted young lady with traditional values.  movie  The first half of the film is a fun-ride. Watching Madhuri Dixit do a ghagra number with Ranbir is a ceeti-moment. At intermission point, the film rightly leaves you yearning for more.  The first twenty minutes of the second half is mundane. But the action comes together again at Aditi's wedding. Against the backdrop of the big, fat Indian wedding in picturesque Udaipur, the friends unite for the festivities. But the chinks in the armour show by way of their mixed ideologies and changed priorities. Of course there's no battle big enough that friendship cannot surmount. So, between tears and cheers, Bunny, Naina, Aditi and Avi forge equations that are more real with one another and with the audience.  Ranbir is delectable and a true-blue superstar. This pedigreed actor dances like a dream, looks terrific and emotes effortlessly. Watch out for the scenes with his father Farooque Shaikh. Deepika is first-rate as is Kalki. Evelyn Sharma and Kunal Roy Kapur provide humour.

She even warns a client that 'beauty creams' are for external use only. The scene evokes laughter, thus making you believe the film could turn out to be a fun comedy.  Unfortunately, within few minutes, you realize the film has no story in the first place. You see Priyanka's bachelor neighbour-cum-best friend Shammy (Dev Goel) loitering around in his house in colourful underwear. He even sniffs one of his underpants, thankfully, when he isn't wearing it!  The hyper-enthusiastic, forever-smiling Shammi (much to your annoyance) all of a sudden decides to attend a wedding in Pune and convinces Priyanka to accompany him. The film is all about what happens on that road trip.  The journey gets unbearable for you as an audience as there is nothing funny or adventurous about anything or anyone here. The film fails to qualify as a comedy to begin with. The jokes won't even make a 5-year-old laugh.  For instance, a man dressed as a gorilla scares off the hero in the jungle, a boy dressed as a Spider-man chases the heroine, a rowdy goon Amladi (whose dad is supposedly associated with common wealth games, get it?) gets into pointless banter with the lead actors, Chunky Pandey plays not double or triple, hold your breath...some 4-5 roles and hams endlessly. Actors speak in South Indian, Parsi and Bengali accents in an outdated attempt to make you laugh!  Sanjay Dutt, Anupam Kher and Juhi Chawla are in guest appearances. Given the lack of a story, even their presence fails to salvage the film. Adah Sharma is decent. She must choose her films wisely. Dev Goel smiles from the beginning of the film till the end for no reason. His over-acting is irritating. However, the two cannot do much, given how silly and 'wannabe funny' the film is.  Making a 'comedy' is not everyone's cup of tea after all.

Ruia.","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" It doesn't matter what the intent of the filmmaker is, if the execution fails to live up to the concept altogether. Zindagi 50-50 aspires to stress on the dilemmas of the lower middle class inhabitants of Mumbai. That significant aspect however takes a backseat as the film resorts to sex and sleaze to get the point across. In order to attract the masses, besides the ample skin show, dialogues are loaded with sexual innuendo, all of which is unnecessary. As a result, you do not empathise with any of the lead characters of the film. Why these people do the things they do is not clear either. Portrayal of women as mere victims of lecherous men in power is hard to buy.  Madhuri (Veena Malik) is a sex worker, who knows she is the best in the business. She does not regret anything until she finds solace in Birju (Rajan Verma). Birju is married to righteous Rupa (Supriya Kumar) whose world revolves around her husband. Naina (Riya Sen) is a junior artist who aspires to be a lead heroine. How far can you go to realise your ambition, forms the story.  The film is full of cliches and topics that have been addressed in movies a billion times before. As the film ends, you wonder if the filmmaker justifies adultery, prostitution and exploitation of women in general, including the casting couch. You also wonder if there is an underlying message in the film, which hints that a woman needs to sleep around to get ahead in life! The lewdness in dialogues and scenes puts you off.  Veena Malik is confident. The role offers her huge scope to pout, swear profusely and show off her body. She does it wholeheartedly, thus doing complete justice to her role. Supriya Kumar gets a meatier role and she enacts it well. Riya Sen has nothing much to do. Rajpal Yadav is wasted.  Toh Se Naina, a song sung by Rekha Bharadwaj is beautiful and probably the only good thing about the movie.

Alas, in Prem Soni's Ishkq in Paris, this doesn't happen. The girl is afraid of commitment and the guy is happy to play along. So they soak in the sights—the Eiffel Tower especially—drink, dance, make a mock film and do several insipid things but never get around to being serious. Love is not on the agenda as yet.  Nearly one half of the film is wasted, doing precious nothing. When your patience starts to wear thin, you're told the reason why the beautiful Ishkq is against commitment is because her French mother Marie (Isabella Adjani) has been ditched by her Indian father (Shekhar Kapur) when she was just seven. This Indo-French girl therefore lives in a cocoon; hates marriage and fears divorce.  movie  So even though romance may have stared her in the eye at that chance meeting with the light-eyed Aakash, on their first night in Paris, Ishkq continues with her life as if nothing ever happened. Aakash returns to London where he is a humdrum existence as an agent(whatever!). Few reels later, they reunite at one of his friend's wedding in Paris. In round two, they drink, frolic and dance. To the audience's delight, they even manage to snag a balle balle with Salman Khan in a lovable cameo. By now, Aakash is very sure that he loves Ishkq. However the stubborn woman that she is, she will not concede. Finally the script runs out of steam and Ishkq, thank God for that, runs straight into Aakash's arms in true Bollywood style.  Preity Zinta's maiden production has its aesthetics in place. Paris is enchanting. The actress is good but there ends the show.

The boys even scan the ladies and their assets mentally, in order to identify them. Their offensive behaviour takes a backseat when Yuvaan gets attracted to London-returned Aayra (Chetna Pande). Just when love and commitment are about to happen, an MMS clip changes their life and beliefs forever.  While the performances, cinematography, songs, production value are all decent, what disappoints the most is the director's uncertainty about the topic he wishes to highlight. The need of teenagers to upload everything online, craving for sex early in a relationship, TV news channels and their obsession with TRPs, victims of media's sensationalism...too many issues have been addressed. This mishmash elongates the film, without letting it become as effective as it could have been.  The film works fine as a campus romance but that track too gets disrupted by the MMS scandal, which comes painfully late in the movie. Also, the moment you start feeling for the characters, the film enters the 'media bashing' phase, thereon entering altogether different territory. The inconsistency concerning the story disappoints.  Ruslaan Mumtaz and Emma Watson-esque Chetna Pande are easy on the eyes and act well. Ruslaan in particular is impressive in emotional scenes. Hope he gets better films to showcase his talent. We wish his character was defined better.  The film has a lot to offer, especially for youngsters but mentions of too many moralistic issues leave you frustrated. The film tries too hard to cater to the young generation and their dilemmas. The narrative keeps beating around the bush for way too long.

And if you wondering why the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's name has been used; well we're told he was a traitor, who proclaimed that 'kinship shouldn't come in the way of kingship.' In other words the end justifies the means. .  Arjun Kapoor is still raw and needs polish to juggle the shades required to balance a twin role.  Sashaa Agha is petite, pug-nosed and has a nice figure. But her portrayal of the golden-hearted whore, like the one Parveen Babi played in Deewar, is insipid.  Rishi Kapoor is in top form. Whether he is playing white, black or grey, this veteran rarely falters. Prithviraj Sukumaran is in fine fettle, his sultry looks adding to his sulking character. Jackie Shroff , the 80s superstar who had been lost to inconsequential cinema is making commendable appearances now.

However, the actors seem to think that 'intensity' means 'to constantly shout out your dialogues'. The acting is over-the-top and as for the song interludes, the less said, the better.  The family tree of the dacoits is traced and several scenes are dedicated to the rise of dacoits like Phoolan Devi, her predecessors (Shriram, Lalaram, Fakkad, Mustakeem, etc.) and so on. The story of her male counterparts is also depicted. So too is the rise of another dacoit called Kusuma Nain who married the dreaded thug, Maan Singh, and consequently rose in power.  All the real-life elements that one might expect to see in such a film - revenge killings, debauchery and so on - are there, but the film flounders. Scenes are needlessly stretched and some situations, overly dramatised. The idea and intention behind this film was probably sound, but the execution falls far short of what this movie could actually have turned out to be.  "},{"Name":"Four Two Ka One","Release Time":"Apr 27 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Jimmy Sheirgill, Rajpal Yadav, Nikita Anand, Sushant Singh, Murli Sharma","Director":"Anwar Khan","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":"2 hours 7 minutes","Review":" Four Two Ka One, 'the title' reminded us of Shah Rukh Khan starrer One 2 ka 4 (2001). While there is nothing common between the two, Four Two Ka One also looks like a film which belongs to the past decade. The film is a comedy with a message.  Speaking of comedy, the humour is clean and works in parts, although most of it looks dated and naive. The execution and treatment given to the film doesn't look like it's been made keeping the present-day audience in mind. The modest production value doesn't help either.  The film revolves around jobless friends Vijay (Jimmy Sheirgill) and Raja (Rajpal Yadav) who struggle to make ends meet. The supposed thieves steal a mysterious bag, hoping for a change in fortune. However, on possessing the bag, the two get entangled in chaos. There begins the comedy of errors, tale of mistaken identities. While the bag is chased by many for their own reasons, its contents make Vijay and Raja analyze their life and ideologies. What's in the bag?  The film has a touch of Priyadarshan-esque comedy, where characters keep chasing each other. The second half is high on emotions and drama. The story has a heart but overall, it's something you have seen before, thus making the film look a tad jaded.  Comedy is Rajpal Yadav's forte and he does it well. When was the last time you saw Jimmy Sheirgill dance? After doing a series of solid serious roles,the actor tries his hand at comedy and fares well. The song and dance routine looks too cliched and unnecessary though.  Murli Sharma, Nikita Anand and Sushant Singh are decent in supporting roles.  This formulaic comedy of errors won't make you laugh out loud but it doesn't bore you either.

For some it's a sleep-derived person who walks around as if in a trance. For others, it's a soulless creature who can be revived by witchcraft. But in Krishna D K and Raj Nidimoru's Go Goa Gone, the zombies are some interesting creatures who've overdosed on a drug that is said to be more dangerous than MDMA, or Ecstasy as most of us know it. And now these living people have turned into a brain-dead lot who know nothing but hunger.  movie  So where do you find these zombies. Wait. Let's start at the beginning. Three fun-seeking friends—Kunal Khemu(Hardik), Vir Das(Luv) and Anand Tiwari(Bunny) join Puja Gupta(Luna) at a rave party in Goa. Their host is a Russian Don—Saif Ali Khan(Boris). The night is young; the company vivacious. Drinks are aplenty and the drugs lethal. As the party reaches a crescendo, the friends find themselves enthralled. Alas, there's a price to be paid. Each of the three friends wakes up the next morning `wasted' and in fairly interesting company. They have a zombie or two in their vicinity. Scared out of their wits, the three friends and their girlfriend, Luna, run for their lives. But it isn't that easy. The island is now home to a large group of fast-mutliplying zombies, who are eager to make these human-beings `meat' for their insatiable appetite. Boris, their knight-in-shining-armour attempts to rescue them but the zombies are not easy to shake off. As the part hilarious, part scary adventure continues, you find yourself laughing aloud with the three boys and their wisecracks. And you also find yourself scared shitless of the zombies who keep cropping up unannounced in their creepy avatar.  Go Goa Gone is positively different from anything you have seen before. And for the young and restless(tattooed, ring-pierced, rave-party enthusiasts) or even those who like whacked-out fun, it's a great ride. With easy performances from Kunal, Saif, Vir and Anand and the crackerjack dialogue, the film will keep you in splits for the most part. What is a little tiring though,is the pace of the zombies, who are a bit too monotonous. Sachin-Jigar's Babaji ki booti adds to the mood, almost tempting you to light up and lie back. The shores of Goa and Mauritius seem enticing enough. However some of the situations in GGG are repititive. Hence, the laughs that were coming spontaneously till a point become a bit forced at some juncture.

She's no topper. Far from a head-turner. She's Gippi (Riya), a gregarious, gol-matol gal. The bindaas backbencher, who doesn't sweat over low scores in class, or being overweight with mass. Damn the parlours, beauty queens, gossip gals and fashion magazines, these aren't her favourite subjects. There's lot more going on in her small world of 'heavy-weight' teenage troubles.  Gippi is the class klutz and the butt of jokes; no thanks to motaapa and her 'boyfriendless' status. She shares her naivete (and other 'horny' secrets and 'men'strual issues) with her BFF Aanchal (Doorva). Gippi's strongest support is her bro Booboo (Arbaz), as well-rounded as his name, and single supermom (Divya) who grooms her on everything from bras to boyfriends. When the Mean-Bee, Shamira (Jayati), challenges Gippi to compete at the school elections, she suddenly finds a goal, but will the free-spirited Gippi transform herself in to one of the 'mean girls'?  Riya shows her adolescence angst with childlike mannerisms and sweet, spontaneous reactions. Jayati is a regular high-school hip babe; Doorva is endearing with her oil-soaked plaits and guileless expressions. Arbaz entertains with his fetish for all things girlie, except the gals. Taaha scores well, and Divya Dutta excels in her part.  Sonam Nair's 'coming of puberty' film handles simple issues sensitively, though it doesn't delve too deep. The subtlety appeals, but lacks drama in the second half, with a mediocre climax. Teenagers will find a slice of their life in Gippi, and adults might protest to such 14-somethings extreme indulgences in fashion, hot-bods and green-tea diets. The mom-daughter moments exude emotions and shed the typical broken-home baggage. Overall, a simple story that stays pre-pubescent and doesn't quite grow into the high-school of stories.

They giggled when Bheem gulped down his favourite laddoos and even clapped when he punched the bad guys. Immensely popular on TV as well, the Chhota Bheem franchise has become one of the most popular animation series in India and rightly so. The characters are adorable. There is enough and more humour that can entertain people of all age groups and the story-telling keeps you hooked.  As far as story is concerned, as we all know, Bheem's biggest power is his strength and this film too revolves around it. He plays a saviour once again. This time, he takes up a task of saving the people of Bali from the clutches of cruel witch Rangda who wants to destroy their god to become the mightiest. On the other hand, Bali's Prince Arjun seeks revenge from the witch as she holds his parents, the king and the queen captive. Bheem and his friends Chutki, Raju, Jaggu, Kalia, Dholu-Bholu promise to support Arjun. Can the tiny gang win the battle?  Just over two hours, the film does not drag or sound preachy unlike most other Indian animation films based on mythological characters. The director keeps his story-telling simple and sweet. There are no unnecessary characters. Songs take the story forward and add to the fun. The epic war towards the end too is nicely executed.  Most importantly, the animation quality is way better than its Indian contemporaries. It's a perfect vacation film for kids. You too can accompany them. The film will make you smile.

Scenes from India's very first film 'Raja Harischandra', a silent movie made by Dadasaheb Phalke in 1913 were also screened for us.  Filmmaker Shivendra Singh Dungarpur through his documentary 'Celluloid man' acknowledges archivist PK Nair, who collected these masterpieces single-handedly and formed the NFAI. The National Award-winning film is a tribute to the man, who preserved the cinematic heritage of the Indian film industry for decades.  The film is a comprehensive coverage of Nair's extraordinary life journey.From Trivandrum to film studios in Mumbai to finally ending up as a film collector in Pune, from an aspiring filmmaker to a strict archivist, various facets of his life have been captured beautifully.  The film shows Nair recalling various memorable moments of his life like why he watched most films backwards, how he collected Phalke's films' reels personally from his house in Nashik and other reels from junkshops. Why he never threw anything, from movie tickets to weight tickets (for they had actors' face on it), his passion for cinema knows no bounds.  Noted film personalities like Jaya Bachchan, Shyam Benegal, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Raju Hirani, Gulzar, Mrinal Sen to name a few speak of their association with the film custodian, which makes the documentary more interesting. We found Naseeruddin Shah and Sitara Devi's quotes the best though. Naseer confesses how it was Nair who introduced him to world cinema.  The major portion of the film also stresses on how 'archiving' is not considered important by filmmakers and government alike, as reels are dumped, left unattended for years. Few have even caught fire in the past.  Films mean much more to Nair than entertainment. \"I understand the world and people better through cinema\" says he. If you feel the same, don't miss out on this one.

Loving families, skin-tight genders, glittering stardom and happy endings get tossed about by the four directors here. Does this work? Yes - and no.  Straight up, Karan Johar's film smashes his own mould - forget about loving your parents, Johar shows a gay youth Avinash (Saqib Saleem) pummeling his father while quitting home. Avinash befriends glamorous Gayatri (Rani), wife to Dev (Hooda) with whom she has passionless, infrequent sex. Avinash meets Dev - sparks fly. While Saqib convincingly portrays odd-ball Avinash, Hooda simmers with tangible tension. It all ends in tears, delightful coming from the archetype of extra cheese himself. This is Karan Johar unleashed - and impressive with his taut film.  movie  He's followed by Dibakar Bannerjee, adapting a Satyajit Ray story, featuring Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Purandhar, dreamer with a theatrical past - and a tiny Bollywood role. Dibakar quietly underlines how talent needn't dazzle the world but simply please the people we love. Siddiqui and Amrapurkar - popping up in a vision - crackle while Nawaz's act sans words is superb. However, elements like an emu are lost in translation, leaving you wanting less whimsy, more control.  Zoya Akhtar presents better balance. Little Vicky (Naman) loves being a girly dancer. Katrina Kaif's his muse - his manly dad isn't amused. This unpretentious flick explores childhood's innocence facing magical, kitschy stars. There's some meandering but tight acting makes up.  That isn't so with Anurag Kashyap's short from stereotypically scatological small-town-land. Vijay from Allahabad must have Amitabh Bachchan taste a (possibly fungal) murabba to please pitaji - he succeeds but fails. The trouble is, neither the dialogues nor the acting move you enough to care. Kashyap indulges himself and eulogizes the Big B - but also has chota shehris looking pretty banal. On the upside, BT's best song amidst a lackluster score's here - but there's too much sugar for this short to stay crisp.  So, BT's a good experiment, celebrating movies, mindsets and Mumbai's moods - but it isn't the coolest film doing so. Woh picture abhi baaqi hai, mere dost.

But the maker takes the cinematic liberty of changing the material at hand to make his film and characters more engaging. Or should we say largely entertaining.  15 minutes into the film you know Gupta means business as knives gash, guns explode, blood flows, actors mouth expletives galore and items girl gyrate shamelessly.  movie  SAW has two protagonists—Manya Surve(John Abraham) a bright college student from the 70s, who finds himself inexorably drawn into a vortex of crime. The other leading man is Aafaque Bagraan(Anil Kapoor) a trigger-happy cop who wants to clean up the streets of the maximum city.  As the police and the criminals play the regular usual cat and mouse game; the screenplay introduces the viewer to endless gangsters and their girls. There's Vidya(Kangana Ranaut), Manya's love-interest, Sheikh Munir(Tusshar Kapoor), Gyanchod (Siddhanth Kapoor) and a couple of more hoodlums who are his henchmen. And you have their deadly opponents—the Haksar brothers, Zubair (Manoj Bajpayee) and Dilawar(Sonu Sood). Manya and Zubair wrest to take over the Mumbai mafia. Quite naturally the opposing gangs bay for one another's blood. And in true Bollywood style, the slaying is interrupted only with the swaying; so you have three item songs lined up. The first item has adult star, Sunny Leone, whose song—Laila teri Le Legi is alone worth the price of a ticket. This Canadian-Indian girl is such an object of desire; she makes other dance girls pale in comparison.  The other selling point of the film is Milap Zaveri's dialogue. Many of the lines are claptraps. But be warned, there's a liberal peppering of filthy lingo that will make you cringe. The performances are largely A-grade. Manoj tops the list. And though he's a Mafioso, his demeanour will get the maidens to melt. Sonu who plays Dilawar, succeeds in spreading menace and speaks eloquently with his eyes.  John is the one with the maximum screen time. From vulnerable to invincible, from a testosterone wonder to a believable actor, Manya is his career's best act. Tusshar is earnest and effective. Kangana may not have the item song benefit but she has recall value as the anguished gangster's moll.  Siddhant Kapoor, son of baddie Shakti Kapoor is also a young talent to watch out for.  Anil Kapoor does his encounter specialist act with elan. He's supported ably by Ronit Roy, Mahesh Manjrekar and Jackie Shroff who puts in a guest appearance as the police chief.  SAW ultimately belongs to Gupta, who stays true to the genre and makes a welcome return to the credible lot of Bollywood directors.

Rajesh Bachchani takes the road less travelled and makes a film which pleasantly surprises you.  Shreedhar Upadhyay (Hussain Kuwajerwala) is an ordinary accountant who is unhappy with his lower middle class status. He dreams of a better lifestyle for himself and his girlfriend Sonu (Anjali Patil). As luck would have it,his boss (Rio Kapadia) offers him the life he aspires to lead, provided Shree gives 12 hours of his time to him for a scientific experiment. 20 Lakhs for 12 hours tempts Shree to accept the offer. Little does he know what's coming.  Thereafter, you see Shree getting tangled in a series of mishaps. He struggles to comprehend what's happening around him. For a major part of the film you are as puzzled as the protagonist. As the mystery unravels, you may not feel totally convinced by the motives of the characters but that doesn't affect the strong buildup. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Well-known face on TV, Hussain Kuwajerwala delivers an effortless,unpretentious performance. He singlehandedly carries the film on his shoulders and does it well. His casting is perfect. However, Anjali Patil goes over-the-top with her Maharashtrian girl act. She is uninhibited as an actor but way too loud for your liking. The supporting cast acts well too.  Songs take the film forward instead of simply adding to its length. Overall, Shree is a well-scripted thriller. Go for it.

She sings. He, for his stardom. She, for her supper. And the twain meet. In a restrobar, where she croons and he swoons. And Aashiqui is born. Again! Retelling the celebrity story that stardom ain't an easy ride. It sometimes vrooms and then goes sputter, the fuel of celebdom often running out. Like Rahul Jaykar (Aditya) discovers; once basking in a 'rockstar' like status, but soon losing it to alcohol, addiction and self-deprecation. But when he meets budding singer Aarohi (Shraddha), his heart finds a new beat and his crumbling life finds a cause. He trains her to become the Nightingale of India; she shines while he stays her shadow; sometimes sober, mostly stoned. The real lyric of this story is their romance, pulsating with passion and intensity - on high notes and 'higher spirits'.  movie  Suri's musical love story doesn't bear much semblance to the original 'Aashiqui'; instead it finds its own rhythm. He pitches the story with old-world romance, high-drama and well-crafted heart-breaking moments. Aarohi's character is endearing and Rahul stays 'bottled' (like 'Devdas' with a cause), with sudden outbursts. The story slows down in parts and the climax might seem unreal to many, but maybe a 'fix' for die-hard aashiqs.  Aditya is likeable in mushy moments, he shows intensity in flashes but sometimes loses grip. A mature role like this demands a lot, nonetheless, it's a good effort. Shraddha looks innocently beautiful. Letting her emotions play out brilliantly in high-strung scenes with supreme confidence. This is a talent to look out for. The jodi's palpable chemistry heightens the drama. The music is the strongest supporting cast, with captivating tunes like Tum Hi Ho (Arijit Singh), Sunn Raha Hai (Ankit Tiwari) and Bhula Dena (Mustafa Zahid) pouring more passion in to the story.  This could be good soup for the lovers' soul - with a dash of old-world flavour.

Bored of their disciplined hostel life, the two decide to run away and travel across the world in a ship, along with Vishi's explorer uncle Swami. As per the plan, the two children manage to escape from their hostel. But do they find the ship? Do they live their dream?  Life Mein Hungama Hai is a cute film, which has that 80's children's-special documentary feel to it. The story keeps you engaged and like a child, you too start hoping for an adventure. The chidren's journey, the main story of the film, has been executed well. The simplicity of the film works. Lead performances by the children and cameos by Jackie Shroff, Urmila Matondkar, Paresh Rawal and Boman Irani are perfect.  However, since we are in the year 2013, and the genre of the film being 'adventure', the film needed better cinematography. The preachiness in story-telling is a bit of a spoiler. Since, the production value is low, it gives the film a dated look or was it indeed shot years back? We don't know.  Songs look unnecessary.

Set in North India, the story can even be termed archaic. It's got a hero, a heroine and a villain. Small-town goon AK-74(Jaideep Ahlawat) is irresistibly drawn to the local, fire-brand beauty Simrit Kaur(Pooja Chopra). When she resists, the bad man threatens her. She elopes to escape his advances and naturally, she's chased by AK's band of baddies. Fate smiles on her when she accidentally bumps into Karanveer Dogra(Vidyut Jammwal); a commando; so well-trained in guerrilla warfare; he can be rightly called a one man army.  The action shifts to the forests. The commando and the girl break into a run with the villains, local forest officials and killer dogs hot in pursuit. From here on, the film picks up tempo. Enter South African action director Franz Sphilhaus. The director hands over his hero Vidyut to him and the combination is pure magic. Perhaps one of India's best martial arts exponents (at least in the films); Vidyut is terrific.  With the stealth and dexterity of a jungle cat, this commando goes for the kill. For the first time in eons, the action scenes are totally convincing...and you can digest the fact that one man can kill them all and come back alone. If you are an action junkie and if you have peaked on Sylvester Stallone's Rambo-series, then our desi Commando, is what you will term paisa-vasool entertainment. The adrenaline rush stays with you, long after the lights come on.  Vidyut Jammwal is in top form, doing full justice to the job at hand.  Action superstars Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn may have superstardom and years of experience on their side; but Vidyut has the agility and novelty to match their moves. He's orgasmic to watch.  Pooja Chopra (Femina Miss India-2009) is super-confident in her film debut and a welcome addition to Bollywood's heroines.  One should also put in a couple of lines of praise for Jaideep Ahlawat, who has made the transition from a small part in the art-house Gangs of Wasseypur to the big-time Bollywood baddie. He's mean, menacing and maniacal without trying too hard.

Annoyed by his taking off randomly, his girlfriend Vinni (Kirti Kulhari) walks out on him. Saddened, he tries to find solace in nature and sets off for Lansdowne, Uttarakhand. Lonely in the forest, he gets bitten mysteriously. The 'bite' transforms him into a zombie.  If it wasn't for the film's super-sluggish pace, abstract and ineffective build-up, it had the potential to be different. An attempt is made to keep the feel and mood a tad imaginative by going low on dialogues and activities, but that only evokes boredom. 30 minutes into the movie and you're still waiting for the zombie to make an entry. The film has been shot in a documentary-drama style which disappoints as the treatment doesn't work, given the genre. There is no 'thrill' element at all, an absolute necessity here. The 'silent nothingness' goes on forever.  The film becomes a gore-fest, once the zombie starts munching on human and animal flesh. Though bloodshed is what you expect from this movie, and it provides it in abundance, nowhere does it manage to truly scare you. It grosses you out. You don't fear the zombie or curiously anticipate his next move.  You're also subjected to a series of flashbacks, (Danny Boyle's 127 Hours-style) which seem unnecessary. Those scenes do not imply anything and only add to the length. Since the film is the first part of a trilogy, the sequel promising more 'action', lack of story development could be forgiven. In spite of the lackluster script, Luke Kenny acts well, looking menacing as a zombie. Ritu Janjjani's makeup looks realistic, sound effects are apt.  Rise of the Zombie is a one-man, one-line story which fails to keep you hooked.

While a rebellious Rucha struggles to deal with her alcoholic father, Ritu hopes for a miracle that would save her dad from dying and former sex-worker, Meenakshi hopes for a better future.  The film mirrors the kind of lives we lead today. Through humour, it addresses the gravest tragedy. It also makes us wonder if it's better to live a lie instead of succumbing to the harsh reality. The concept is great, but the execution could have been better. Sleazy Mr Choksi (one of the clients), Meenakshi's shayari and never-ending philosophies, Ritu's sister's marital woes...various sub-tracks fail to engage you.  Theatre actors, Aahana Kumra, Shruti Vyas, Nivedita Bhattacharya act well. Aahana will remind you of Anushka Sharma. She is as effervescent and earnest. Pooja Pradhan (as the woman in charge of the spa), fits the bill. Naseeruddin Shah as the spiritual babaji, who says, 'In Ssssooonaaa Sppppaa, girls don't sleep with you but for you' evokes laughter.  Sona Spa is 'futuristic' yet relevant to current times.

His love for daughter Nia (Doyel Dhawan) is as deep as his hatred for wife Maya (Bipasha Basu). After it becomes impossible to bear his violent nature and decipher his whimsical attitude, Maya decides to part ways. She hopes for a better future with Nia, but destiny has different plans. Her disturbing past comes haunting, pushing her to a breaking point and risking the lives of those involved.  Aatma is not a full-fledged horror film with ugly demons and gruesome deaths. It attempts to play with your mind and even succeeds, though partially. The film takes off swiftly, coming straight to the point. Burning candles, thunderous rain and sleepless nights, Suparn manages to subtly induce the 'shock' element, especially in the form of Maya's eerie nightmares. It sets the mood perfectly for a supernatural thriller. The 'Aatma' here is unconventional too, considering there is no over-the-top demonic 'look' to it. No typical background score is used to create atmosphere either. The film skillfully manages to be different from most in its genre.  However, it loses grip as it proceeds. The second half gets predictable, repetitive and formulaic, making the climax look a tad inconsequential in spite of the twist. The 'fear of the unknown' gets replaced by zombie-like killings, making you wonder what led to the random transition. The special effects are not up to the mark either. Those who have seen Andres Muschietti's spooky horror 'Mama' will be able to draw similarities between the two in terms of concept.  Bipasha Basu is impressive as the harrowed mother who shows immense patience in tackling this paranormal situation. She looks equally stunning sans makeup. The immensely talented Nawazuddin Siddiqui unfortunately looks out of place, a misfit in the role. The very cute Doyel Dhawan is perfect as Nia.  Aatma may not send shivers down your spine, but it dares to be unconventional.

While the wedding preparations are in full swing, Tej's son Sameer (Saqib Saleem) is the daft guy who aspires to woo the hot 'Shakira of Chandigarh' Jazzleen (Rhea Chakraborty). She calls him 'psychic' (thinking it's the same as 'psycho') and he tells her, 'I am love you'.  In order to patau the pataka, Sameer uses the new car and ends up losing it! The car goes missing, thus forcing Sameer and his best friend Gattu (Prabal Panjabi) to form a complex web of lies to save Sameer from the wrath of his father.  movie  The film sticks to a YRF's (Yash Raj Films) staple brand of entertainment; it revolves around a Punjabi family, the backdrop a lavish Punjabi wedding. Since the 'Punjabi' card has been used in films for years, it makes the film look a tad conventional.  However, in spite of certain cliches, the film manages to entertain you with its effortless performances, simple story and situational humour. Scenes where Sameer and his friends are being chased by cops, Gattu referring to Sameer's poor English as 'tatti English', are hilarious. The bride's outrageous dance number on her wedding day and the Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa-esque climax are few of the high points of the movie.  Rhea Chakraborty as Jazzleen is easy on the eyes, Prabal Panjabi as Gattu is adorable. He evokes maximum laughter. Saqib Saleem is pleasant but lacks the charisma of a lead actor. Ram Kapoor acts over-the-top as required, Ravi Kissen is wasted.  Don't expect an out-and-out comedy, the film is a light-hearted family entertainer with a message for the youth. Do take your dad along for it, in his gaddi!

Jolly (Warsi) is a struggling mofussil lawyer, itching for big-city deals. He convinces girlfriend Sandhya (Rao, attractive and effective in her hot schoolmarm-avataar) and hits Delhi's District and Sessions Court where his 'office' is a desk under the sky. Jolly flounders about until he meets the super-polished, super-successful Tejinder Rajpal (Irani), arguing the 'victimization' of his rich client Rahul Dewan, whose Land Cruiser's run over six labourers on a footpath. An eye-witness appears - Jolly files a PIL. What happens when Rajpal replies using cash?  movie  Rather like its protagonist, Jolly LLB's first half meanders a bit, featuring a clumsy 'daaru' song and a Meerut that mysteriously hides - but boy, does its second half hammer things home. With crackling scenes between Jolly versus Rajpal (Irani deadly smooth, like velvet soaked in blood) and Rajpal versus judge Tripathi (Shukla in a brilliant show, hysterically yelling, \"Gavel kidhar rakha hai?!\", thundering at Rajpal, \"Sit down! Ye mera court hai, aapka club nahin!\"), the action becomes electric. Drama builds as Jolly (Warsi, highly endearing and impressive) finds his voice. Jolly's astonishment at Rajpal's callousness - \"Footpath sone ke liye nahin hai\" - Jolly responding, \"Footpath gaadi chalane ke liye bhi nahin hai!\", mirrors the aam aadmi's bewilderment and determination to fight.  Jolly LLB works because of its bigger point - decency is for all and worth fighting for. Using bittersweet satire and plot twirls, the film shows corruption even used against the corrupt. Despite that weaker first half, this truly becomes a Jolly good show.

Probably on your speed dial? Press 'G' (for ghosts) and get connected to anyone at 3G speed on the 'other side of life'. In the 'no network' zone, where no 'App' in the world can help trace the number of the 'deadly' ones. This movie ventures into the supernatural sphere, where spirits wine, dine, ball-dance and make passionate love. They even horrifyingly haunt until the alive have to turn to the dead to hold on to their dear lives.  Sam (Neil) and Sheena (Sonal) are on an unending vacation in the exotic Fiji islands, where he buys a second-hand cell phone (with 3G) to stay connected. One night he wakes up to a terrifyingly freaky video call, which soon becomes a recurring phantom-phenomenon that wrecks havoc. Their romantic holiday gets 'possessed' by series of frantic, fearsome events and fallacies - powered by evils and illusions of the human (and inhuman) psyche.  Shantanu and Sheershak's core idea - that people receive phantom calls which are believed to be spirits trying to connect to our world - is dreadfully shocking, even unbelievable. The story idea can freeze you in fear. Sadly, 3G doesn't quite do that. Yes, there are a few scream scenes, paranormal panic, blood-curling (and blood-drinking, really) and phantasmal moments (car crash scene, Sam dancing with the dead and parts of the climax), but eventually it goes 'out-of-range' and drags stiffly with the weight of the dead.  Along with a series of brutal events, the film is lavished with sinful series of bold kisses (perfectly tongue-in-mouth types), well shot and brave, very brave by Bollywood norm. Neil impresses and lives up once again; he's better as evil than good. Sonal sizzles in her bikinis, shows spark in some scenes and for the rest of it she wears a faintly shocked expression.  With a few chills and fewer thrills, the 'spirit' fizzles here, with little left to toast!

The family struggles to make ends meet with just one earning member, Noori, who runs a beauty parlour but that isn't sufficient. Thus, they come up with a plan that ensures them immunity from growing prices for the next three years.  The family decides to get a loan of one lakh rupees in Gopal's name with the excuse that he wants to set up a shop. The loan is granted under a government scheme with the condition that it's cleared within three years. The idea is to stock up ration worth a lakh which will last for three years, thus dodging inflation in the process. Money saved will be used to clear the loan. The plan works fine until a loan inspector (Zakir Hussain) suspects foul play!  Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga has a brilliant concept, earnest performances and clean humour. It addresses inflation, one of the most relevant topics that's plaguing our economy today, and even offers a unique solution which may not seem realistic but gets you thinking. The film however falls short of evolving beyond the basic idea, which curtails the impact it should ideally make.  The film has some poignant moments, especially when the old father fears humiliation if they're caught and Puttan speaking his heart out on how inflation affects the middle class. We however wish there was no love track that involves Gopal. The film also becomes a tad theatrical and preachy in portions. Performance-wise, the film stays flawless.

Yes, it has explosives of another kind - 'bangs' (it's a total 'bed'-bangers ball, what gall); Weapons of Mass Seduction and politics of bistar and beyond. This sequel, a strange mix of foul games and passionplay, unfolds with a crippled Saheb (Jimmy) holding onto the last vestiges of his shrinking Kingly pomp and glory. His boisterous biwi, Madhavi devi (Mahie), mostly depressed and drunk, lives as Chhoti Rani in the same haveli, but the couple share nothing but extreme hate and contempt for each other. Biwi, is a ruling MLA who knows little about rajneeti but mixes it brazenly with saucy traits and seductive moves to stay on top. Enter, gangster Indrajeet Singh (Irrfan), with a mission to topple Saheb (to avenge his family's lost royal honour), while his love-interest Ranjana (Soha), vulnerably falls prey to the political chess.  movie  Tigmanshu Dhulia has created an intriguing world with rajas fighting for their kingship; politicians watching porn, gangsters sleeping with the enemy, and women unapologetic about adultery in the ballroom and bedroom. The setting and story is vibrant, dramatic, dark and humourous at the same time. Once again, he scores with his characters - intelligently sketched, with dichotomous layers - dark, brooding, loving and lustful. The editing and the screenplay in the second half lose steam, and the item number (courtesy Mughda Godse) punctures the pace. The climax passively surrenders without the satiating feel of bittersweet revenge.  Irrfan is absolutely terrific; he shows fury, passion, envy, pride with such utter conviction that you crave to see more of him onscreen. He's undoubtedly one of the finest performers we can boast of. Jimmy is excellent as the poignant, wheel-chair bound saheb exuding power. Mahie Gill is volatile as the unfulfilled woman desiring more, though her drunken drawl often leaves us more dry than high. Soha plays her part with subtlety and sophistication.  This may not be Tigmanshu's best, but it's a movie with more balls than most cinema can flaunt.

Nirvaan however disregards Natasha's advances, thus making her further attracted to him. After playing the seduction game, the two finally get together but there's a trap. There is more to Nirvaan than meets the eye. In his back-story, we are introduced to Radhika (Shilpa Anand) who essays another significant role in the film. The mystery behind Nirvaan's motive and Radhika's presence in his life unfold as the story progresses.  The film has decent production values and good songs but weak performances. The acting even leads to unintentional humour in a few scenes. The story with its twists and turns seems interesting initially but becomes way too far-fetched to keep you engaged. Natasha-Nirvaan track seems loosely based on Sridevi-Anil Kapoor banter in Laadla.  The filmmaker doesn't falter completely. It's the convoluted script that needs to be blamed. The writer becomes so ambitious to add the thrill element that he loses the plot somewhere. Most of the scenes seem unnecessary and add to the length of the film for no reason. The climax doesn't justify the build-up either.  This Isshq looks promising but ends up being forgettable.

Music executive Ishaan Sabharwal (Abraham) is a spoilt brat, his adoring mother Nisha (Wahab) teaching him he's the best, so he thinks he's irresistible and behaves like \"a sexy idiot\". Ishaan won't commit to his executive girlfriend Anushka (Singh). Sick of his light flirtations and heavy refusals, Anushka throws Ishaan out.  He moves to a new flat - with a hot new neighbour, fashion stylist Gauri (Desai). Their vibe crackles as Gauri challenges Ishaan, making him realize being a jerk doesn't work. Ishaan splits from his bitchy boss Beena (Sen having a ball, wryly going, \"Clap, clap\"), starts his own group and is about to commit to Gauri - when his sister Shivani (Mathur) tells him Anushka's expecting his child.  movie  IMAM has an interesting plot and a progressive message. Some performances - Wahab coolly announcing, \"Maine tumhare Pa ko chor diya hai\", Desai as sexy wild-child Gauri, squealing \"Ooooh, strip-tease!\" as Ishaan peals off his shirt - are good fun. It's well-shot, showcasing stylish homes, lovely clothes, luscious drinks and luscious Abraham working hard at depicting super-selfish Ishaan.  But IMAM has issues too - the acting is superficial. There's lots of flashing dimples and pouting lips but not one performance that's convincingly power-packed. Storyline turns are too fast and fluffy. For a movie on the music industry, the score's fairly bland. Small details - the designer bag on Beena's arm, the guard catching Ishaan and Gauri in a changing room, Shivani describing Ishaan, \"Majnu ki tarah phone par laga\" - are fun but the big picture lacks thrust.  This niche movie doesn't nail it but it's a cute watch, floating by humming - \"Take it easy, thora moody, thora cheesy.\"  "},{"Name":"The Attacks Of 26/11","Release Time":"Feb 9 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Nana Patekar, Sanjeev Jaiswal, Atul Kulkarni & Ganesh Yadav","Director":"Ram Gopal Varma","Genre":"Crime","Duration":"","Review":" The date is unforgettable. When terror scarred the face of Mumbai in one blood-soaked gash of death and mass destruction. Held to ransom, ravaged by horror, imbued with venom of a genocidal mass murder that made us all question - 'Why? Why Us?'  That Black Saturday of 26/11, when ten couriers of terror brought in their package of loaded guns, ammunition and a barbarous game-plan of mayhem in Mumbai. This film is RGV's tribute and testimony to the lost lives, shattered survivors and martyrs of 26/11.  movie  The first-half (docu-styled) shows Joint Commissioner of Police (Nana Patekar portraying real-life Rakesh Maria) narrating episodes of the catastrophe - as it happened.

Like other memorable cinema in this category, Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Rang De Basanti(2006), Rock On!! (from the same director, Abhishek Kapoor, in 2008) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), Kai Po Che, too, is a story of male bonding in the time of the devastating Gujarat earthquake and the disturbing Godhra riots.  Based on Chetan Bhagat's The 3 Mistakes of My Life, in his second outing, Abhishek Kapoor raises the bar by giving us a thoroughly enjoyable film that showcases the strong emotions between the three protagonists who are boisterous, ballistic and at times plain bored.  movie  The film captures their trials and tribulations in the post-college, pre-what-career-to-pursue period. They have two passions -- cricket and their camaraderie. And two of them (Ishaan and Omi) also have concerned parents who want them to find direction quickly. They find temporary succour when they turn their passion for the sport into a business venture; opening a store selling sports equipment. The rebellious Ishaan (whose raison d'etre is cricket) sobers down a bit as he lands an opportunity to impart cricket coaching to the neighbourhood Muslim boy, Ali.  But the screenplay gathers momentum when tragedy strikes in the form of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2002 Godhra riots. Both these calamities expose the chinks in the armour of the friendship between the boys. They also throw open the can of worms that brought to light the tainted Hindu-Muslim hatred, one of the darkest chapters in the history of Gujarat.  There is also a nicely handled romantic track between Amrita Puri (Vidya) and Govind that adds a lovely touch to the proceedings. The performances of the three boys -- Sushant Singh Rajput (Ishaan), Raj Kumar Yadav (Govind) and Amit Sadh (Omi) -- are the finest one has seen. A special mention for Sushant who has the best role and manages to do full justice to it. Amrita Puri is very likeable. Amit Trivedi's music is soulful, leaving you mesmerised.  Despite the disturbing backdrop of death, destruction and politics, Kai Po Che is very likeable. Between tears, you find yourself smiling, because it's the story of friendship and human triumph above all else.

Yes, it has un(don)e the deadly Don and given us an all new, improved, purified soul. Bole toh, a bhai with a big-heart; who does more bhaichara than bhaigiri. He has a sense of 'humours' (bhai style), says 'ladies first' (chivalrous, alright) and is a master in 'bhai-ology'.  Meet Jayantabhai (Vivek), a small-time Mumbai gangster, who's more Munnabhai than Jayantabhai, really. While JB tries to win over his big boss Altaf bhai and become his right-hand hench, he bumps into his friendly and feisty neighbour Simran (Neha) - struggling to find a foothold in big, bad Mumbai. Over anda-bhurji and endless banter in bhai-bhasha (refer to dialect dictionary for Dons) he falls in love with his pretty 'English Vinglish' padosan. Simran grapples with 'single-girl-in-big-city' issues like roti and makaan; as far as kapda goes, she's somehow impeccably dressed at all times (huh!). They develop an endearing bond (with lovable chemistry); and Don suddenly turns into dilwala, and a new chapter on luv-shuv is introduced in 'bhai-ology'.  movie  Vivek is cool, confident and in his 'fulltoo' element. He's donned the bhai role several times, but Jayantabhai is total jhakaas. He adds zest to his character, with 'donnisms', punctuating it with bang-on comic-timing. Neha is a delight onscreen; looking stunning as 'bubblegum' or 'babe'. She shows immense spark, performing with spunk and style.  Vinnil Markan's 'feel-good' goofy 'gangsta' story is told with simplicity and modesty. It's not a slick, stylized gang-fest with shootouts and shenanigans, but an uncomplicated story of a good-goonda who wears his heart (instead of his gun) on his sleeve.  The screenplay is average and it waits a while to take-off.

And if it's a Bhatt enterprise - Death it is! Swifter and slicker! Devoid of remorse, regret or redemption. Exposing the obsessive in the romantic; the fear in fantasy. Love bloodied with lust and lingerie, sin and satin. With bare bodies caught between hot-beds and cold coffins. So there, the 'Murder' franchise is back - to kill love the third time over.  Vikram (Randeep) a hotshot wildlife photographer (shoots 'wild'-live women too) woes and seduces a waitress Nisha, (Sara) who moves into his huge, haunting home. He's passionate by night and philosophical by day, brooding and bedding with intensity. Nisha, the damsel-in-daze, is flustered by Vikram's cryptic conversations and supernatural sights and sounds in the house. The vital signs are cliches, like windows clattering, strange vibrations, and flickering lights. More often, the bathroom scenes steams up the suspense and waters it down just as quickly. But there's a bigger mystery lying here. Vikram's ex-girlfriend, Roshni's (Aditi) sudden disappearance makes him the prime suspect in the case, with cops tracing the 'body of evidence'.  movie  With more mystery than grisly murders, debutant Vishesh Bhatt works around a story (a remake of a Spanish thriller) that's 'fleshy' enough (minus the sex and eroticism of a 'Murderesque' series) creating an eerie setting, with sombre moods and suspicious characters. He solely relies on the strength of the story without glossed-over effects and style, which is commendable. The first half ghost-walks into a comfort zone (with songs, romance et al); while the second half terrifyingly twists, with raging emotions and shuddering shock value.  Randeep smoothly builds tension with his silent and mysterious performance. Aditi's deranged act and traumatic breakdown at betrayal is impressive. Sara only adds beauty to the horror. The lilting music (Pritam) intonates the thriller. 'Murder 3' is a decent remake, the story stands out in this genre. It thrills in spurts but bleeds in parts.  This one's no bloody Valentine, but watch it if you like it twisted.

And groove to beats of the alphabets of dance. Vishnu (Prabhudeva), a choreographer with an elite dance academy is unceremoniously ousted by the ambitious and artistically inept head honcho, Jehangir (Kay Kay).  The reason is simple. Their ideologies are out of sync - Vishnu believes in true talent, Jehangir trades talent for trophies and TRPs. The former says it's about 'performance', the latter claims it's about 'packaging'. Vishnu is on the verge of giving up, until he spots a gang of footloose street-dancers performing at a Ganesh Utsav. He tangos with chaddi-buddy Gopi (Ganesh) to train them to compete in a dance reality show. They set the dance floor on fire, but not without their grooves, greed, lifts, let-downs, flip-ups and fragile egos. And of course, some 'hip-hop'-hurrays too!  movie  In the film, Prabhudeva says, \"Dance apne aap mein ek nasha hai. Jab yeh nasha ho, aur koi nasha nahin ho sakta!\" Bingo! And when he takes centerstage, your jaw drops and heart leaps. He acts a bit, emotes in parts, but dances in a rhapsodic high.  Ganesh Acharya lends support but is overbearing at times. Kay Kay moonwalks through his part; spewing arrogance and attitude in style. The film introduces a host of new faces (in a kickass chase sequence), of them Salman, Dharmesh, Punit and Lauren are show-stoppers.  With India's first 3D Dance film, Remo puts his best foot forward. The film lacks dramatic-density, but the minute dance breaks in, all hell breaks loose. This isn't a 'step-up' from anything you've seen before. The 3D impresses in parts with predictable routines, but he pitches the emotional tempo towards the end. The grand finale act is spectacular, better than all reality shows strung together.  This movie isn't about the A-to-Z of dance; but if there's rhythm in your body this one will move you.

It is so painfully pointless that throughout the film you only keep thinking about what could have been the purpose of making this film!  We assume, it is supposed to be a thriller but not a single scene is engaging, let alone thrilling. The lead actor sleepwalks though his role. He seems disinterested altogether. The girls, even the ones who are shown as doctors, dress up scantily for no reason.  Love scenes, songs are added to forcibly connect the disjointed plot. Dubbing, dialogues are so bad that it evokes laughter.  The usage of English, rather bad English in the film is possibly the biggest suspense of the film! You fail to realize the need of 'hinglish' in the script. Certain adjectives, lines are repeated endlessly. The word 'court' is not mentioned even once in the movie without using 'honourable' before it! For example - According to 'honourable court', hum aisa kar sakte hai, 'honourable court' ke anusaar etc etc. 'Maintenance' is another word you will hear a lot in the film.

Here it goes. With cool conmen, cops, chases, mind, matter and maal. But first, meet the members of the con-club. The asli khiladi Ajay (Akshay), quick-witted, daring and strong-willed - he's the master-planner. Sharmaji (Kher), a wee-bit weak-hearted, but the real 'loin of Punjab' (with 8 bachchas and going strong). Add in, Iqbal (Kishore Kadam) and Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) - who add muscle to the master-mind. In the late 1980's these conmen pose as CBI officers and raid malaamal matris, business magnates and jewellers.  With no records or FIRs - they escape after every heist with a clean (white) conscience and loads of black money. A (real) CBI inspector, Waseem (Manoj) along with sub-inspector Ranveer (Jimmy) get on a deadly chase to nab them while they're faking it. Well, if you want to figure out con-asli, con-nakli, go ahead, wear Sherlock's (Holmes) suit and crack this one.  movie  With an ingeniously layered role and a brilliant act, Anupam Kher truly 'steals' the show. Akshay hits hard, with pure, unadulterated acting, minus action. Manoj is always in command, fiery and fantastic. Jimmy lends strong support; Kajal Aggarwal (Ajay's love-interest) flashes smiles in interludes, and Divya Dutta throws in laughs.  Inspired by a real incident, Neeraj Pandey cuts to the chor-police chase and weaves an intelligent, mind-racing thriller, keeping you tightly strapped to your seats. It captures the 80's era beautifully; and the cinematography (Bobby Singh) is a cut above (special mention"},{"Name":"Vishwaroop","Release Time":"Feb 9 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Kamal Haasan, Pooja Kumar, Rahul Bose, Shekhar Kapur","Director":"Kamal Haasan","Genre":"Action","Duration":"1 hour 50 minutes","Review":" Like Hollywood that is obsessed with Osama Bin Laden and terror post-9/11, actor-writer-director Kamal Haasan, one of India's finest film talents, gets drawn to Osama this time.  The action moves from America to Afghanistan back to America. The timelines go from 2002 to the present. Pre-intermission, the action is set in the terror-infested arid locales of Afghanistan (enchantingly captured) where the hot-blooded Aghanis are all mujahideen, fighting their demons, the Americans. Rahul Bose heads a local terrorist outfit; Kamal Haasan joins in the strife. Life is hard, customs banal, punishments extreme. But Vishwaroop doesn't offer you anything you haven't heard or seen before.  movie  Here one should give the devil his due. The filmmaker is thorough in his study on the subject, transporting you to Afghanistan, making you partially empathise with what is the sad state of affairs in this kingdom ever since the US stepped on this soil.  Rahul Bose's sentence - America is shedding blood for petrol, we're shedding blood to protect Allah - captures the essence of the plot. Kamal also captures nuances of how the gun-culture has seeped into the children of Afghanistan; even blindfolded boys recognise AK-47s and 11 mm bullets!  In the second half, Osama is gone. Televised speeches show Obama preening on victory. But the film tells you that the danger is far from over. Muslim terrorists are still baying for the blood of the Americans. And, some psychos continue to dabble with dirty bombs and suicide bombers. The FBI and an Indian intelligence group are trying to foil an attack that could lead to mass destruction.  Intentions of this film and the maker are good. Kamal's performance is A-grade. However the film fails, especially in the second half because there are no lump-in-the-throat moments; nor is there any shock and awe.

Unlike his usual screen persona, the super entertainer of Bollywood plays a character that has grey shades and he does it with conviction. It's refreshing to see him do something different. As a bonus, you also get to see him dance and those moves are still unbeatable.  Priyanka Chopra apparently signed the film as a 20-year-old. Almost 10 years after the film was made, she still promoted it and that's noteworthy, since her garish makeup and outfits of the 90's make her look anything but glamourous! Few scenes have been re-shot recently to make the film look less outdated but it doesn't help much considering the shuttling between her current and yesteryear look is pretty obvious.  As far as the story is concerned, the film is a Hindi remake of Tamil film Priyamudan. Boy falls in love with a girl. He's willing to do anything for her. The obsession gets dangerous as the love story involves a murder.  Like films made in those times, Deewana Main Deewana is a package which has love, drama, thrill, dance, comedy and possibly everything that's needed to keep you engaged in a Hindi film.  The major problem is however the film's delay. Because of the decade-gap,you feel like you're watching the film on a Hindi movie channel in your house! Lack of newness is a spoiler. You go to the theatre, preparing yourself to sit through an 'old' film and thus, in spite of it being decently entertaining, it fails to grip your attention.

Not really, just refer to the 3 different Davids who play protagonists in this 3-piece drama. D1 (Neil) is the dreaded gangster Ghani's protege in 1970's London. He talks less, and kills more with lethal looks and loaded guns, and romances Noor (Monica) with deadly passion. A rival gang exposes shocking facts about his past which collapses his (under) world.  D2 (Vinay) is a dude in a family of devout Christians in Mumbai. He's a struggling musician whose life loses rhythm when his Dad gets embroiled in a politicized issue. For Christ's sake, really!  D3 (Vikram) is a fisherman in a Goan village, who is more Devdas than David, low on life and high on daru - any time of the day. While he broods about lost love to confidante Frenny (Tabu), he quickly falls for his best friend's fiancee, Roma (Isha Sharwani).  Bejoy Nambiar presents his story with visual flair - superbly styled, aesthetically rich. While the 1970's era is imaginatively shot in B&W, laden with retro tunes; Goa of 2010 is stunningly picturized with boats, brides-in-white, priests and tunes of Mario Pitache.  The film swiftly transitions between eras, dramatically changing in colour, content, emotion and drama. Even the music - rock, remix, retro - blends beautifully across time zones. It suffers at story-level - the first half builds intrigue and enthusiasm, but turns blase soon after. The plot with D1 grips, D2 goes so deep to find purpose it loses us, and D3, even with interesting mix of characters leaves us in stupor.  Neil's performance is restrained and powerful. Vikram is fab as drunken David, and Vinay shows fire as a rebellious youth. Tabu is terrific as always, Monica fiercely stands her own, Isha stays pretty and pleasant.  Yes, the Devil's in the detail. But maybe David needed more 'D' of 'Depth' in the story to make this more 'Delightful'.

As a mother who single handedly raises her four children and then gets abandoned by them in her old age, her performance is heartrending. She proves indeed that age is just a number. While her performance is a highlight of the film, the subject is cliched. Bollywood has made umpteen movies revolving around helpless parents and their ungrateful, insensitive children. Mai however has its moments when it comes to showing the mother-daughter bond.  Mai (Asha Bhosle) is abandoned by her son Munna after he decides to shift to the US. Eldest daughter Madhu (Padmini Kolhapure) does not shrug off her responsibility for her ailing mother, like her siblings, in spite of being opposed by her journalist husband (Ram Kapoor). Madhu's teenage daughter and husband claim that they need space. Madhu ignores their displeasure and gets Mai, who is also suffering from Alzheimer's, home.  The film tries too hard to be tragic. There was no need for the story to be so melodramatic. Ram Kapoor misbehaving and sulking owing to his mother-in-law staying in his house seems illogical. Why does he have a change of heart later is equally appalling. Few scenes seem equally unnecessary.  Padmini Kolhapure is effective but doesn't have a well defined role. Her daughter's character seems to be written on the lines of Sridevi's ill-mannered daughter in English Vinglish. Songs are unnecessary obstacles that add to the length, except for the lullaby Chanda Ki Bindiya, which is sung beautifully by Asha tai herself. Ram Kapoor acts well. Anupam Kher shows what a good actor is, even in the few scenes he appears in.  Scenes which show Madhu taking care of her mother like a child leave you teary-eyed. We wish this aspect was given prominence. Supporting characters and their woes prove to be a distraction. The modest production values don't help either. Cinematography is weak with most scenes looking hazy and out of focus.  Asha Bhosle slips into the role of Mai effortlessly. We wish the story had something new to offer though.

Yup, with a 'K' too, jee! Well, this one doesn't come with swanky couches, designer do, verbal wars or rapid fire rounds. Also, the host-with-the-mostest is the lovely Mrs. Leela Krishnamoorthy (Deepti Naval); whose homemade blend has the flavour of warm memories, brewing relationships and brimming ideas. Also, every cup is served with her sun-washed smile - all on the house. No wonder, from college kids high-on-caffeine (who endearingly call her 'Mrs.K'), to couples and travellers - all converge at Leela's unique library-cum-coffee-shop called, 'Book A Coffee.'  Amongst the regulars here is Jayant Sinha aka Jazz (Farook Sheikh); whose passion is capturing moments through his camera lens. He's 60 something, but still in the 'groove' with the young 'uns, and over coffee he finds love and companionship in Leela (widowed 12-years ago). Amaya (Swara Bhaskar), Leela's daughter is a shot of espresso - strong, fiery and free-spirited; she immensely adores Jazz uncle, but is outraged at the thought of any man in her mom's boudoir. Their lives are torn apart like curdled milk, until one of them finds a way to brew a fresh latte all over again. 'Cause this love story was not about copulation-over-coffee-beans to begin with.  It's the return of the unforgettable Farooq Sheikh-Deepti jodi after over two decades. And what indulges you more than the coffee, is their nostalgic chemistry, timeless warmth, and engaging conversations - all freshly ground. With superb actors as such, emotions run high, expressions are many and dialogues just enough to give that cinnamon flavouring to cappuccino conversations. Swara Bhaskar naturally adds her flavour to this role, serving a good performance.  Avinash Kumar Singh has sensitively handled a strong subject textured with social and psychological complexities. His characters peel layers of emotions, without over-dramatizing scenes, or amplifying the issue. It is subtle and sincere. Downers? The songs don't add much, and the length makes our coffee go cold often.  If you want to grab a fresh flavour, this one is worth a 'shot'.

Akaash (Kartik Tiwari) and Vani's (Nushrat Bharucha) is a college romance. Like all campus love stories and films made in the 80's and 90's, they go to a snow-clad hill station on a college trip where love blossoms. The couple sings songs and dreams about their fairytale future together until parental and societal pressures force them to part ways.  The bitter reality of life shatters dreams. Vani who has always looked at life through rose-tinted glasses, finds herself trapped in an obnoxious, loveless marriage.  Given the situation of women in the country, the film rightly touches upon topics like psychological, sexual harassment post marriage. The characters, issues are realistic and sensible; except for the multiple irrelevant songs and scenes that drag the movie endlessly. Length is a major flaw.  The film boasts of some solid performances. Lead actress Nushrat Bharucha is highly impressive. Sunny Singh Nijjar, who is seen in a supporting but crucial role as the chauvinistic husband Ravi, fits the bill. Kartik Tiwari is decent but needs to grin less and emote more. The film has an impactful background score, which helps in creating the somber mood required during the crucial confrontation scenes.  Akaash Vani makes women realize that it's more important to be happy and respected than being considered as righteous. It works strongly as social drama than a love story.

Kinky, huh? Not really. This is what goes into a high-flying, testosterone ride called Race 2, where everything blows up - from beastly cars to bronzed beautism. Macho men dive into mid-air and cars casually fly. The men are smart, but their gizmos are smarter. The women are 'haute', but mean machines give them a run for their curves. Such is this race of brawn and biceps (with limited brain power).  Lambi race ka ghoda, Ranveer Singh (Saif) is on a mission again - to avenge the death of his lady-love. On the race-track he encounters Armaan Mallick (John) and his half-sister Aleena (Deepika), reeking of wealth and power in Turkey. Omisha (Jacqueline) joins the race as Armaan's seductive love-interest. Lastly, there's the conman, RD (Anil) and his X-factor Cherry (Ameesha), with their fruity diet and juicy one-liners. Everyone is racing for a reason, albeit with less speed, and oodles of style.  movie  While Saif flamboyantly fuels the race with max horse power, John uses his mind-'blowing' body for 'knock-out' action scenes. Diva Deepika flaunts her natural pizzazz; Jacqueline looks good and tries to keep pace. With puns and playfulness, Anil Kapoor thoroughly entertains, flanked by his 'fruit-bearer', Ameesha who cutely plays the clueless Cherry.  Heists, hot-babes, roulette, raging cars, gizmos and gags - Director duo, Abbas-Mustan have thrown in everything with pompous grandeur, save for a riveting plot that shocks or stuns. It focuses on superbly digitized Hollywood-esque actions scenes, racy chases and blow-ups (plus a 'designer' star-cast that salivates on style) - all of which, a visual treat - but it doesn't make your heart race, really.  Wish they'd traded in their glitzy stilettos for running shoes and slick suits for a solid story. Then this race would still be in the run, we think.

Ruia","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Kantaben (Juhi Chawla) runs an orphanage and funds it by mostly running a small-scale pappad business. One rainy night, she finds a baby abandoned in a basket, outside her orphanage. She takes him in and nurtures him. The circumstances in which she finds the baby, reminds her of Lord Krishna's birth and childhood. She thus names the boy (Namit Shah) Krishna. Krishna suffers from epilepsy. Things change for better for the boy, after he befriends Lord Krishna.  The film is not a full-fledged animation film. Barring lord Krishna's character and a few portions, the rest of the film is not animation. We wish the animation part was more as without it, the dramatic story isn't as effective and engaging.  The animated Lord Krishna is super cute and is the reason why you forgive the disjointed storyline. He is the hero of the film. The animation is decent if not first-rate. Juhi Chawla plays a Gujarati character and we aren't sure if that is the reason why she chooses to go loud with her dialogues and expressions in most scenes. She makes you feel as if you are in a Kurkure commercial! She becomes subtle eventually for good.  Katrina Kaif and Hrithik Roshan are seen in special appearances. While Katrina's looks like a forced scene, Hrithik impresses even in the small but emotional scene he features in. The film, in fact, seems inspired by Hrithik's Koi Mil Gaya, where he overcomes all his short-comings after befriending an alien. Here it is Lord Krishna who creates magic and makes the world a better place.  Social issues have been unnecessarily added to the story. Child labour, discrimination on the basis of skin colour, milk being mixed with dangerous chemicals... add nothing to the story.  It is the presence of Lord Krishna that will make the kids in particular, ignore the flaws and enjoy the film which has both mischief and tears.

He gets harassed by cops and villagers for crimes he didn't commit, in every possible way, physically, psychologically and sexually!  Life changes for Bhola when he's rescued by Lochan (Arshad Khan). A politician's ace shooter, Lochan makes Bhola realise that to be feared, one must know how to use a gun. The two become star sharp-shooters, formidable names in UP's gang wars. Will Bhola be able to keep love and loyalty aside to be the best in the business?  The film intends to show the major role gun violence plays in politics but ends up focusing on one individual. There is no revelation in the story or emotional connect with characters. The film also doesn't take a stand on violence. Atrocities against girls, rich exploiting poor, are issues touched upon but seem unnecessary.  Dialogues seem more scandalous than authentic. The hero says, \"Mard banne ke liye doh cheejen aani chahiye - condom chadana aur bandook chalana (you need to know two things to become a man - how to use guns and put on a condom).\" Performances and songs are impressive. Actor-director Aditya Om plays his part with conviction. Arshad Khan is decent. Rekha Bhardwaj's song 'Chunav Re' stands out.  Bandook leaves you a tad confused about what exactly the filmmaker intends to portray. Positively, it doesn't glorify gun violence and captures the UP mafia well.

Inkaar is like that. Polished-looking, its edges - the tension of feeling harassed at work, office politics, ego flashes - hold rather well. But its centre collapses in a soft mess. Featuring advertising hot-shots Rahul (Rampal) and Maya (Singh), Inkaar shows the heat and dust from work- place lust. It begins with Rahul and Maya meeting in a swimming pool after an old affair, seven years spent apart - you'd rather like to know what they're saying, but in what becomes an annoyingly familiar move, their words are drowned by background music. Next, Maya's promoted by the company where Rahul is CEO and was her mentor - and lover.  Here's where Inkaar should've begun rising - as Maya climbs the ladder, Rahul feels things shake and starts acting odious, passing wise-cracks or vibrating heat. Maya slaps a sexual harassment case onto him, to adjudge which social worker Mrs. Kamdar (Naval) arrives. But instead of becoming tauter, the film starts to unspool. Rather than let characters grow or scenes fully unfold, the camera careens around, frequently distracting. That's when the background score isn't flooding exchanges - although not drowning out Mrs Kamdar's remark, \"Arre, do khoobsurat log kaam par jayenge, time spend karenge, toh sex toh hoga.\"  movie  Alongside such howlers, the acting doesn't hold. Rampal's good at the snide, sardonic ex, recalling how he taught small-town Maya it's not \"Channel\" for No. 5. His nasty-tasty Rahul makes some mark but the same can't be said for Maya. Despite all that lovely make-up and the luscious hair, we just don't get enough sense of Maya's tightrope tangle between ambition and passion. But we do learn a lot about the corporate world presented here, where everyone gargles with whisky, throws up frequently and inappropriate office behaviour is necessary to pass the tedium of selling toothpaste.  In this odd-ball zone, even Mrs. Kamdar looks like all she wants is a drink and out, so there's a vote - yup, a vote - on the harassment. That's amidst Kanwaljeet flitting in and out as a B&W dad, characters dropping glasses like crystal full-stops and one asking another, \"Ye sab kyun, kyun?!\", to hear - \"Kyunki mein gusse mein tha!\"  Such an anti-climax, no.

We've all played the game. But here comes a new twisted tale to show us that there ain't nothing like a good cop or bad cop. A cop is a cop. That sets the premise for this fast-paced police-drama, filled with bad boys and some good fellas.  Shetty (Prakash Raj) is Mumbai's biggest bhai, owning several dance bars - a 'hot-bed' for other nefarious activities for his customers who are always 'tight'. Abhijeet Patil (Sachiin Joshi) is a cocky, super cool (a tad bit stylish too) and an audaciously overconfident inspector; who shows absolutely no mercy for one burning issue - atyachar against women. Of course, along with the 'khakee' comes some 'grey' too. He beds (one-night-stands), bets (on cricket matches) and snorts coke. On the other side, he hooks up with a pretty and pancaked TV crime reporter, Jiah (Vimala Raman).  Adding more weight to this underbelly drama are characters like the unscrupulous CBI Officer, Yadav (Sudesh Berry) who ends every dialogue with 'carrect me if I wrong?'; Patil's boss-cum-mamu ACP Gaitonde (Mahesh Manjrekar), Manish (Prashant Narayanan), another cop and Patil's rival and Shetty's sex-pot, Rani (Gihana Khan), who also doubles up as his item girl.  Sachiin Joshi does a fairly good job of a cool cop with a chip on his shoulder. His bheja satkaoing whenever he sees a woman abused - relevant in today's times. He slips into the character like a gun in a holster. However, what's missing is a booming baritone that could pack more punch. Prakash Raj, in his silk lungis and hard lines like 'jeeto toh rokda, warna Prem Chopra', adds humour with fear. Sudesh Berry strikes with his Bihari accent in a brief role. Aditya Pancholi tries to evoke fear, but doesn't go far.  Ankush Bhatt's slick flick grittily exposes the nexus between seedy cops and sleazy bars barons, albeit with a lot of Dabangg-isms. It has flaws in the first half, and also too many killings - random and ruthless. However, the second half sums up the suspense - blood soaked in tragic truths and raw realities.  It mirrors the ugly face of Mumbai, but one that's desperately calling for a clean-up job.

The film is based on a little gem of a story - a drunken Haryanvi feudal Harry Mandola (Kapur) wants to sell villagers' lands but is challenged by daughter Bijlee (Sharma), assistant Matru (Khan) and surprisingly, his own drunken self that turns softly socialist at the pour of a peg.  Some lines are dazzlers - \"Bachpan se dekh raha hoon, tum dono ki jodi jaise Mukesh aur Nita Ambani!\", Matru growling at Bijlee, \"Apne andar ke jaali saaf karle - haunted house lagne lagi hai,\", sinister CM Choudhary Devi (Azmi) chiding brainless beta Badal (Babbar), \"Yahi farak hai tum mein aur Rahul, Sachin aur Jyotiraditya mein!\" Indeed, lines like gulabi bhains, sapnon ka Lokpal and the say-no-more pancho-pancho tickle you outside the theatre too. Quite like Kapur's performance, as comfortingly elegant as a velvet dressing gown, his comedy silken as mumbling, drunken Harry, his anger tight like a cord as sober Mandola who dreams of money and won't let reality stand in his way - even if that means pledging his darling Bijlee to a loveless life with baba-log brute Badal (Babbar, delivering to the dot).  movie  But here's my angst - this movie could have been so much more. Like champagne gone flat, the film's left lying about for too late, its plot meandering everywhere (including a plane ride through moon-lit clouds, ending in a Maoist meeting), the director so determined to have fun that often, the viewer doesn't. Sure, there are hilarious moments involving pink buffaloes and deep wells, Shakespeare and Sheila Dixit, even a laal rang ka kachcha, and it's all very clever - but where's the self-control? With its intellectual foundation and dramatic potential, MKBKM needed disciplined direction, not wandering shots, predictable banter or dull crudity.  On the upside, Azmi's performance is effortlessly evil until the last swig. Anushka plays her now-familiar loud-spunky-sexy babe, unconvincing but attractive as an eccentric rustic. But despite her Pond-girl entry in see-through top and teeny shorts, Mandola's heart-throb is Imran Khan who's red-hot (literally), stubble and a sardonic air pumping his sex-appeal. With its Trilbys and tractors, malls and Maoism, its stretch limo and smart-boy! lines, MKBKM could have been such a fun ride. But sadly, director ka bhi man dola, rather too often.

This Gangoobai (Sarita Joshi) is like none other. Picture this. She makes it to the elite guest list at fashion shows (in her bright coloured nauvari and tattoo between her brows), she's styled by Mumbai's hot-shot design house, and she spiritedly lives up to the city's bustling night-life. But long before everything turned so 'hip and happening', her life was like was any other ordinary tale.  Gangoo lived in the picturesque hill-station, Matheran, on the outskirts of Mumbai. Widowed early and childless, her life basically comprised of domestic chores in a few houses, her oldie friend Malan, and most importantly, her pet-plants that she nurtured with aai-like affection. In a flash, her life changed forever. Gangoo set sight on her memsaab's daughter's exquisite gara sari (traditional Parsi sari embroidered with flowers and birds) and at that moment, she made the most ambitious decision of her life - one way or another, she would own a sari like that. Even if her dream cost her an exorbitant amount of Rs. 50,000! Deva re deva!  Thereafter, the movie traces Gangoo's pursuits as she sets off for aamchi Mumbai where she meets with her 'dream-weavers' - Daksha (Mita Vasisht), Waman (Purab Kohli), top model Monisha (Nidhi Sunil)and style-guru Rohan (Raj Zutshi). In Mumbai, while she fulfils her only dream, she finds simple solutions for all her new big city friends with big problems. With pure goodness, and some preaching and puranpoli, Gangoo wins over the people of this mahanagari.  In this tailor-made role, Sarita Joshi shows all the warmth, compassion and disposition that Gangoobai's character demands. The simplicity with which she essays this, along with her altering expressions of wonder and awe, says a lot more than dialogues (in a mix of Marathi and Hindi) and proves her extreme calibre.  Priya Krishnaswamy tells a story of simple women with a not-so-simple dream. While her lead actor holds fort, the rest of the cast come up with average performances, leaving bai without much support. The film is 9-yards too long, diluting the essence.  Gangoobai doesn't sweep your heart away, but leaves you with some sweet, feel-good moments.

Pritam is now separated from her husband, so uncle is optimistic about their future together.  Meri Shadi Karao is singer Daler Mehendi's launch vehicle for his son Gurdeep. The production value of the film is average but the major problem here lies with the one-line story, which is stretched for a good two hours.

He boards the Mumbai bound Rajdhani Express with a bag and a gun. He shares the train compartment with Bengali script-writer PC Bannerjee (Priyanshu Chatterjee), Bollywood item girl Sunita (Puja Bose) and Bollywood fashion designer Munish (Sudhanshu Pandey). Full of suppressed anger, unwilling to disclose anything about himself and doing nothing except for holding onto his bag firmly...Keshav's co-passengers find his behaviour suspicious. They doubt his background and intentions.  Is Keshav the man to be feared or does he need to fear the crooked world?  Rajdhani Express has a thought-provoking premise but the execution fails miserably. The film aspires to raise grave questions about the current scenario of our society at large and immoral tendencies of people but all of that gets overshadowed by poor editing, over-the-top performances, pointless scenes and illogical dialogues. It makes the film seem more of an unintentional comedy than a socio-political thriller.  The film is nonlinear. It has several flashbacks that give us a glimpse of Keshav's past. These scenes look funny because of their sheer absurdness. Sayali Bhagat plays Keshav's love interest. Her scenes are so random that you wonder if they were added after the film was completed!  The film has a fine actor like Jimmy Shergill too but surprisingly, he is completely wasted. He only makes an entry just before the interval. His character is not well-defined, making you wonder if he is meant to be a hero or an anti-hero!  The highlight of the film is the debut of Tennis ace Leander Paes. He tries his best to fit into the role he gets to portray but given his image and body language it doesn't work for him. Actor Amitosh Nagpal has dubbed for Paes as Hindi is not his forte. It makes the sportsman look all the more unconvincing and comical in certain scenes.  The film does speed up and changes track for the better towards the end, but the thrill comes too late. That pace was needed throughout the film. Gulshan Grover as Rajdhani's shudh Hindi-speaking ticket collector and Priyanshu Chatterjee are the only actors who manage to keep you engaged on this otherwise derailed express.

The film revolves around the lives of adolescent boy Hansa (Suraj Kabadwal) and his headstrong elder sister Chiku (Trimala Adhikari). Their father goes missing. The lack of an earning member makes the family crumble under financial pressure.  With debts to clear and nobody to help, the kids start finding happiness in small things. A five rupee coin makes Hansa happy while Chiku loves to scare her younger brother in the darkness of the night. The little joys and each other's company help the siblings pass each day.  The film will remind you of the opening line from George Clooney's poignant film 'The Descendants' (2011). Rubbishing the popular perception of most who believe that people who live in beautiful places have beautiful lives, the protagonist narrates, \"Paradise? Paradise can go f*** itself.\" The pain and suffering of the people who live in these places are no less. Hansa in a way sends out the same message but in a lighter way.  The film is heart-warming and the characters real. Mesmerising cinematography by Sachin Kabir is a major highlight. From sunrise to sunset, gigantic hills to small cosy houses, bricks and trees to friends chasing each other in jungles, the film is a gorgeous work of art. Manav Kaul doesn't let the film look sombre in spite of the adversities shown. He makes the film look real, yet fantasy-like.  The child actors give an incredibly authentic performance. Hansa proves that small, independent films need not be abstract or grim to make an impression.

Dabanng 2 is actually a better film than the first, tighter, brighter and sharper. Featuring explosive action and fine detailing - the Pandeys move to Kanpur where cows block the streets, Chulbul asking his hawaldar, \"Hum kisi khet mein ghus aaye hain?\", and being told, \"Nahin sir, main chauraha hai,\" - Dabanng 2 never takes its eye off its heart - Salman Khan.  This is an unapologetic star vehicle driven by Khan who rolls an SUV over with one hand, takes lakhs for his 'police welfare fund' with another, romances wife Rajjo (Sonakshi) with tangible tenderness, dances wild jigs with controlled abandon. Dabanng 2 is Salman's show all the way, every second line - \"Ye Kung Fu Pandey hain!\" - homage to his Chulbul.  movie  But Dabangg 2 features other delights too, like its detailing of local flavour down to the 1980s Bhojpuri hit 'Phulauri bina chutney' playing at a function, its kitschy-cutesy touches (Chulbul's belt dances the Dabangg step on its own), its moffusil-like low-voltage lighting, its heroine Sonakshi glowing with pretty appeal. It features a nice show by Vinod Khanna as Chulbul's reconciled stepfather and tolerable acting by Prakash Raj as Kanpur's creepy Bachcha Bhaiyya, Deepak Dobriyal his slimy sibling Genda.  There are crackling good lines (when Genda's abducting a girl, a hawaldar muses, \"Personality ke hisab se, kuch zyada nahin bol raha?\") and rainbow-like music, ranging from the soft 'Dagabaaz naina' to the electric 'Aadat badi naaspiti, Pandey-ji bajaye duty pe seeti' channeling the classic 'Pinjare wali muniya', mixing it up with a glittering guest visit by Munni (Malaika Khan).  Arbaaz Khan's direction is commendable - he maximises his main star, maintains balance and keeps the movie tight. There are some loose strands - an SP eating 'pisa' becomes annoyingly heavy, Sonakshi's acting stays lean, some jokes are saccharine-like - but at the end, Salman's shirt comes off, so it's all cool. Taking this franchise forward, Dabangg 2 presents a sewaiyyan Western where hot-cop Chulbul is cowboy and stud. If you're up for fun that's purely tongue-in-cheek, this will give you bangs for your buck.

The film revolves around the lives of certain people, their needs and dilemmas. The setting is initially rural and then urban. From Bihar to Mumbai, over the years, people and their struggles, caste system in Indian society, the sexual exploitation of women, everything stays constant. But it's your behaviour that makes the difference. A good deed never goes unnoticed by God.  As a result, a man who gives away a huge amount of money wins a lottery ticket later. An aspiring singer who dedicatedly does his riyaaz without expecting fame or money gets it all later while those who murder a man for money lose their only child. Even money can't save him from dying.  The concept is noteworthy. The film does not get preachy in spite of being philosophical. The problem lies with the pace, editing and the amount of issues addressed. Untouchability, rape, casteism, social hierarchy, national integrity, harmony, karma, democracy, power of satyagraha, villagers being abused by the Thakurs...too many issues make the film go haywire a bit.  The 'Karma' message comes out strongly but the rest just makes the film longer. Mumbai's 26/11 terror attack is another issue that is resurrected. That track could have been a different movie in itself. The Bihari-Maharastrian debate also gets touched upon. The editing should have been stronger as some scenes seem unnecessary. The filmmaker should have stuck to one issue, in order to engage the viewer.  Performances are really impressive. The ones that stand out are those of Yashpal Sharma, Anil Mange and Aditi Bhagwat.  Myoho is an emotional, philosophical film. If you don't mind the excess of social issues, it's worth watching.

They wrote. The 'They' in this case being Mr Maverick's (Anurag Kashyap) team of 12. And this murderous plot comes in 12 different parts - all found on a body part.  Act I begins on the scene of a gruesome crime. A mutilated body soaked in blood and dotted with 12 clues that set the cops on-the-run, cracking the case across 12 cities in India. Each clue more baffling than the other, sometimes uncovering facts, sometimes burying the truth further. The movie traverses through Ghaziabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Kalyan, Hissar, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Gwalior, Delhi and Mumbai, stumbling upon myriad characters - quirky, comical, eccentric, and defiant - in unpredictable situations. Encountering people like authors and aghori babas, teachers and transsexuals, cops and psychiatrists.  The caustic humour in the Kalyan story, the cliff-hanger climax of the Ghaziabad story, the rustic flavour and poetic puzzles in Kolkata's kahaani, the ghazab twist in the Delhi story, the hard-hitting realism of the Hissar angle, are some of the moments that leave you stunned. Though some plots are so radical and quirky that they add more minutes than mystery to the story.  Conceptualized by Anurag Kashyap, 'The Last Act', roped in 12 first-time directors to make 12 short-films that form a part of the same feature film. Every director brings in his own style to this montage-of-mysteries, in most parts it's riveting, leaving you entangled in a web of curious cases. There are truck-loads of actors (not all from mainstream cinema), who perform their bit well, intensifying the plot as they go along. In the second half, the thrill goes thanda in some moments, and you're desperately waiting for the suspense to explode. Of course, with a dozen clues to deconstruct, even good 'ol Sherlock Holmes, Poirot and our desi Agent Vinod would be straining their brains.  With a unique concept at hand and an all-new directors' gang, getting the 'act together' is no mean feat. Team of 12 - Take a bow, this stage is all yours.

Neil loves Mini but not more than Shweta, (Tara Sharma) his would-be wife. Shweta is however, in love with Peter, the mechanic (Neil Bhoopalam). Shweta wants to elope but her righteous lover Peter, fears God and the possible consequences. He refuses to encourage the runaway bride's bold plans.  Somewhere in the not-so-elite market area of South Mumbai, shop owner Ghalib (Rajat Kapoor) sells aphrodisiacs. Ironically, his married life lacks romance and action. Haunted by suspicion, he secretly follows his disinterested wife Roshni (Tisca Chopra) everywhere. This only further drives her away.  Ghalib's mother (Sarita Joshi) finally comes to his rescue. She gives him the magical 'Josh-e-jawaani', a love potion which would solve all his problems! Whoever drinks the potion will fall in love with the person he/she sees first, right after consuming the drink.  Sharat Katariya keeps his film simple and sweet. Multiple tracks run parallel in the film, then cross paths co-incidentally, only to come together in a witty climax.  While performances are decent, the characters lack depth, as they are not established sufficiently. Many questions are as a result left unanswered. You fail to understand why people do the things they do in the film. You wonder why Neil won't marry Mini instead of Shweta. Why does Ghalib follow his wife everywhere? Why would a dominating, pampered and rich woman like Shweta comply with poor Peter's take on them eloping? None of the questions get answered.  While the short duration, makes the film, a pleasant watch; lack of back-stories, makes it a tad abrupt in parts. There are no dull moments in the film but nothing uniquely memorable either, except for the 'love potion track' which makes a late entry in the film.  While initial portions of the film and dialogues fail to evoke laughter, it's the climax which sort of makes up for the loss. It is delightful and unpredictable. If it wasn't for the half-baked characters, the film wouldn't be as forgetful.  Acting wise, Sarita Joshi, Tisca Chopra, Brijendra Kala and Manu Rishi are impressive. Purab and Neil have nothing much to do. Tara Sharma and Koel Purie need to work on their comic timing. Rajat Kapoor gets a boring role to play.  10ml love is a short, lighthearted film. It's a decent watch, provided you don't expect great humour.

This film is a good attempt at revisiting suspense flicks that were a huge craze in the 50-60s. To bring Gen-Now up to speed, back then movies like CID, Mera Saya, Woh Kaun Thi weaved magic on celluloid for patrons back then. But, make no mistake here. Though, Talaash has the mystique of the cinema Raj Khosla; it is modern in its approach and the setting is contemporary.  movie  The plot revolves around a bizarre high profile death of a movie star Armaan Kapoor (Vivaan Bhatena). Aamir Khan (Surjan Singh Shekhawat) is the cop in charge of the case. The clues lead him to Mumbai's red-light area where he jostles between pimps and prostitutes looking for answers.  It's also revealed that Surjan is married to Roshni (Rani Mukerji). But he is like a man possessed on the job because of a sensitive incident in his life.  In a bid to bury his head in the sand and escape his personal demons, he directs all his energies into his khaki uniform.  Coming to the Armaan Kapoor case, vital clues keep taking him to a working girl called Rosie (Kareena Kapoor). Between piecing the mystery together, the cop and the call-girl, develop a relationship that goes slightly beyond the regular.  In the performance department, Aamir Khan should pat himself on his back for a superlative act; he's a powerhouse, flawless from frame one to 10. This superstar-actor should also be lauded for raising the bar in his choice of films and roles, unlike many of his contemporaries who neither have the inclination nor the capacity to move away from the 'mould' they have been typecast in.  Rani Mukerji is one of the finest actresses of this generation. In Talaash she is effortless in her part of a wife in a strife ridden marriage and a mother who has faced a tragedy. Kareena Kapoor looks lovely and sits pretty in her hooker act, going from coy to brazen like a pro.  Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Taimur) has an interesting role as a street-savvy chai-serving sidekick in the flesh bazaar. Again, this is one actor, whose potential Bollywood is discovering slowly but surely.  Ram Sampath's music haunts—especially Muskaanein jhooti hai and Jiya lage na .  Farhan Akhtar's dialogue has fire. But the story written by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti oscillates between real and implausible; making it hard for the screenplay to bridge the gap, especially in some key portions in the second half. At time the pace also numbs you making you shift in your seat. But if you average it out, Talaash is well-worth the price of a ticket.

And he's here with a bang this Diwali - singing, dancing, flipping in the air - all in the mustard fields of Phagwara (that's in Punjab, FYI), classic Bollywood ishtyle. Except that this is a Singham getting Dabangg and Rowdier than any Rathore - on Punjabi steroids - and in total sardaar avatar. Hadippa!  So bring out that tall glass of chilled lassi and let's figure the why, what, who of this desi-ghee story. Jassi (Ajay Devgn) jaisa koi nahi. He falls in love-at-first-sight, in a train with Sukhmeet (Sonakshi), call her Sukh please (she's quite a 'peace' of work); and ends up as a guest in her mad-house full of comical sardaars - The Sandhus. There's the head-of-the-house Billu paaji (Sanjay Dutt), bros Tony (Mukul Dev) and Tito (Vindoo Dara Singh), who've sworn to never have ice-cream and cold-drinks (rum-on-the-rocks is all he's ever had, poor liver, sigh!) until they avenge their father's death; and a kid sardaar who talks about 'pegs' (Patiala types).  movie  Adding solid femme power to this macho sardaar story is Pammi (Juhi Chawla, delightful) Billu's mooh-boli-biwi, Bebe (Tanuja) suffering from part-time memory lapses; and lastly Rajpreet the loved buffalo (who mooed this cheez?) The problem? The Sandhus have been vengefully thirsting for Jassi's head, but can't lay a sword on him because he's their (unwanted) house-guest (mehmaan equals bhagwan, remember?), he even feigns 'paira-te-laces' (paralyses) to stay 'home' to save his life.  Ajay Devgn convincingly plays son-of-the-soil with power, playfulness and colorful pagdis in every scene. He switches from comedy, action and romance flippantly, impressing with funny lines, gimmicks atop a ghodi (Jassi again) and tons of PJJs (poor-Punju-jokes).

Every frame is picture perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flaw--the story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed.  Shah Rukh Khan is Samar Anand a bomb disposal expert from the Indian army posted in Ladakh. He's a brave heart(of the kind you've seen in Hollywood movies like Livewire, Hurt Locker) who has defused close to a hundred bombs without bothering to ever wear a safety suit. His colleagues laud him and refer to him as the man who cannot die.  movie  Samar goes about defusing bombs with such ease; even your fear of the bomb is temporarily suspended, at least through the duration of this film. On the personal front, Samar is a brooder and sleeps with his personal diary strapped close to his chest. Anushkha Sharma (Akira Rai), a documentary filmmaker, who is also in Ladakh, accidentally finds herself in possession of Samar's diary. Since no one has ever told her that it is bad manners to read another person's diary, she leafs through its contents.  And discovers that the army man doesn't smile because of his poignant past. The story unfolds to tell you that in his growing up years Samar, who did odd jobs in London, to make ends meet was footloose till he fell head-over-heels-love-with a rich heiress Katrina Kaif (Meera Thappar). Meera is engaged to be married to a gora but she finds herself inexplicably drawn to the desi Samar; the man who teaches her how to shed her inhibitions and live life king-size.  A road-accident in London changes the course of Meera-Samar's happy love story and Samar finds himself back in Ladakh diffusing bombs. In this strife ridden atmosphere, his path crosses that of Akira; a young girl, who falls for him. Before Samar and Akira's acquaintance turns into anything deeper, the film plot lands Samar back in London, where he meets with a road accident yet again. This time, the hospital authorities, diagnose him with retrograde amnesia... and say he has been in a time warp of sorts for close to a decade. The only one, who can bring him back from the brink, is his first love Meera. And a new chapter unfolds.  Shah Rukh Khan is the backbone of JTHJ. He's charismatic as the lover and enigmatic as the army guy. Katrina Kaif is a smart dresser and looks stunning. She's also a delight to watch in the song Ishq Shava, she having become this dramatic Bollywood film dancer. But when it comes to handling the intense emotional scenes, Kat is still a Barbie doll, beautiful but plastic.  Anushka Sharma is easy on the eye and an ideal fit in the motor-mouth parts. She has the perfect 10 figure but frankly she is saddled with an unsatisfying role.  A R Rahman's music--be it the Challa track or the Heer song never grew on the charts; but in the film, the music charms you because the lead actors infuse life into the songs.  Frankly if someone were to ask what's the bonus you take back from JTHJ. It's the end-credit visuals of Yash Chopra horsing around with his actors or immersed in deep discussion with his crew. These bring a lump to your throat because the film comes so close to his death.

They are not allowed as entry is for invitees only. Fortunately and unfortunately, DK accidentally rams his car into theirs. He apologizes and allows them in to make up for his mistake.  Drug dealer (Shakti Kapoor) and his gang are desperate to do business in Disco's King's club but knowing DK is strictly against it, they plan to kidnap him! The boys get dragged into this fiasco and what follows is chaos.  Not a single element of Dard-e-Disco is 'rocking'. From songs that are totally unnecessary, jokes that are not funny, performances which are painfully over-the-top, sub-plots meaningless....the film drags to death, leading to nowhere. The conclusion of 'saying no to drugs' has nothing to do with the story that precedes it.The romantic tracks of the film are random too. The film lacks continuation. Lack of a good story only makes it worse.  Performances are weak too. Akshay Kapoor tries too hard to sound funny while Sneha Ullal looks blank and stays expressionless. Rituparna Sen Gupta has no great role either. Asrani overacts.  Bappi Lahiri's debut film as an actor is extremely disappointing. Acting is most certainly not his forte.

The film starts off as a comedy, but turns into a social drama, addressing social and political issues like corruption, land mafia, ministers and their vote banks.  As the film preaches satya and ahimsa, you wonder what its relevance to the story is! Yadav very ambitiously tries to rope in multiple issues that are plaguing our society today, but unfortunately the script fails to create its need!  Manav Chaturvedi BA LLB, (Rajpal Yadav) finds his house missing! He wonders how it can just vanish into thin air! He files a complaint with the police, but everyone suspects Manav to be the culprit. Popular perception is that he abolished his own house to claim the insurance money worth Rs 10 Crore. Manav denies it and soon, the weird robbery case catches media's eye. Manav's tragedy becomes front page news with TV channels giving live coverage of his day-to-day happenings. Politicians and cops are forced to acknowledge Manav's complaint due to media pressure. They even file an FIR. Will everybody find out who stole Manav's house, or is Manav lying, as suspected by many?  The puzzling 'who-done-it' story fails to unravel for the longest time. The investigation process in this case should be ideally interesting, but it ends up being so repetitive that after a while you lose interest in knowing the truth.  Rajpal Yadav also plays the *sutradhar* of the film. Being the narrator, he sings 'Ata Pata Laapata' every two minutes, in order to push the story ahead, which does not happen. The film looks like a one-line story being stretched unnecessarily just to consume the audience's time.  Street plays, nautanki, songs, dialogues, everything in the movie addresses social and political issues, but everything lacks clarity. Every petty issue looks like it's been forcibly made to appear as an issue of national interest.  The preachiness and repetition bores you to death. Guess the intention was to make a musical satire. Songs seem like fillers, which only add to the length of the movie, but nothing to the story.

Both are hard-working and take up any given job to make ends meet. The two, however, strive hard to get over mediocrity. Sonia wants to eventually graduate to films from TV, while Ajay seeks a producer who would like his realistic script.  Sonia finds it awkward to be a 'TV star' and yet live in a 1 BHK house in a middle-class locality. She dreams of owning a luxurious penthouse someday. Sonia wants it all and wants it sooner. She drags Ajay to an astrologer who guarantees her a 'bright future', that too, within 7 days. Do things turn out as foretold by the astrologer?  Future Toh Bright Hai Ji has a good concept and it could have worked better as an emotional drama than a comedy. You can identify with Sonia-Ajay's struggles and the daily issues that one needs to deal with in order to be a Mumbaikar. The city of dreams makes you work really hard if you want to live your dreams.  Future Toh Bright Hai Ji could have done so much more with the concept. Unfortunately, it focuses on petty issues which do not add anything to the story. Sonia's silly tiff with a co-star who is more famous, the couple's banter with a Sindhi building secretary (Asrani), the secretary's wife (Neelima Azim) hitting on younger men, a smooth-talking broker (Satish Kaushik) who lures Sonia into buying a flat beyond her budget, a rich politician-turned-producer who harasses Ajay to deliver a script good enough to launch his son...all the characters act well, but hold no importance in the story.  The real trials and tribulations of life in a metro remain unaddressed. The film does touch your heart towards the end, but everything in between seems totally unnecessary. Sonal Sehgal looks good but overdoes the small-town girl act and accent, Aamir Bashir is expected to play an understated character, but he ends up looking uninterested instead. Satish Kaushik has good comic timing as usual.  The film would have worked better as a sentimental drama. Were it not for the forced humour, the film wouldn't be as forgettable.

The time has come. To turn your pages to the epilogue of a perennial epic. The aftermath of the Ram-Raavan yudh. Post tales of Sita's silent sufferings, Hanuman's veer vanar sena, Lakshman's undying loyalty and Rama's terrific triumph. Brace yourself for the next chapter - the final one, at that. And it's no 'child's play'!  'Sons Of Ram' unfolds in post-Ramayana period, where Sita (Sunidhi Chauhan) is 'Vandevi' (Goddess of the forest) and lives at guru Valmiki's ashram with her twin sons, Luv (Aditya Kapadia) and Kush (Devansh Doshi) - the troublesome-twosome famous for their indestructibility and innocent misadventures. While Luv (a striking shade of blue) reminds you of Ram's qualities - calm, controlled, dauntless and skilled at archery, Kush is spirited, brave, adventurous and hot-headed. While the kids are being raised faraway from their kingdom by Sita under the guidance of Valmiki, King Ram, on the other hand, is worried about the future and longevity of Ayodhya. He seeks guru Vishwamitra's advice, who tells him to perform the 'Ashwamedh Yagya'. Ram consents, but there's a gambhir problem here. This divine ritual demands that his family (Ram with his better-half) has to participate in this holy event, and one way to do this is to find a suitable bride for the King again (to replace the banished queen) OMG!!! In the meanwhile, Ram sends a royal stallion free in the woods, as a sign of marking and expanding his territory. The horse finds its way to Luv-Kush's ashram and upon learning that it is Ram's stallion-of-statutory-announcement; the brothers decide to brave his attempts and put up a fight (Bravo, bachchas!). Of course, the L & K Bros have their own dream-team in their ashram. Mangal the peacemaker, Bheelu, a die-hard Ramayan fan, Sohan who dreams of playing with Hanuman's tail, Agaj, the mini-villian in this drama, and the humongous creature Gandharva who adds mass to this mythology.  Amar Chitra Katha's first feature film (inspired by Anant Pai's 'The Sons of Rama') grips you (not as tight as Raavan's clutches though) mainly because of the detailed narration and unraveling of various lesser-known facts and figurines from Ramayana. The animation is good, but we've seen better strokes and more stunning visuals in recently released films. The 3D here adds little to the overall effect of the film. Director Kaushal Ruia doesn't showcase masterpiece in terms of visual brilliance and special effects, but he can take a bow (not the one that kills) for his storytelling which wins you over, evokes curiosity and leaves you wanting to pore over your history katha all over again.

Everyone's welcome to dig in. Pure vegetarians, hard-core non-veggies and others. Because, this dish is more a slice of life, than a chicken drumstick, really. So bite into it (with a pinch of salt, of course). A decade after fleeing to the Punjus' very own phoren land, UK, Omi Khurana (Kunal Kapoor) returns home to Lalton village, Punjab, only for selfish reasons.  movie  A UK gangster wants his 'pound' of flesh (Omi owes him big moolah) and the only way to 'chicken' out of this mess is to run home to the rest of the Khuranas (he 'makes no bones' about being a good-for-nothing, loser). His homecoming is met with mixed reactions, while some are overwhelmed, like cousin Jeet (Rahul Bagga) and maa-like-chachi, the rest like the curious chachu and bhooka Titu Mama (Rajesh Sharma) don't break into a bhangra routine immediately. The head-of-the-house, Daarji (Vinod Nagpal), has lost his memory, and with it the family has lost its biggest secret - his trademark Chicken Khurana recipe, which was the hottest item on their dhaba menu. Everyone remembers the taste, but no one has cracked the secret ingredient. Hungry for more, read on. Omi's plan to swindle money off his family goes kaput, and in the meanwhile luv-shuv steams with doctorani Harman (Huma Qureshi), and with zero culinary skills he's on a new mission to rediscover the lost recipe, reopen the family dhaba, and reawaken his other senses (of love and life).

Such detailing - irregularly placed photos in Samar (Hashmi) and girlfriend Ahana's (Ghatge) home, favourite coffee mugs from which media tycoon-types sip their whisky, a T-shirt cheekily promising 'Endless Vacation' landing a billionaire in jail - add heft to this tale. Crime journalist Samar loses his job over a 'shooter ka shocking sach' from hired gun Prince (Sharma). Sam's seduced into joining 'Crime-24', owned by Roger Khanna (Pancholi - looking fresher than he has in decades, making money from, as he says, 'kir-minals' merrily 'voi-lating' rules), run by Lisa Kapur (Dhupia) offering him crores - if Sam doesn't broadcast how crimes Crime-24 'breaks' are actually committed in-house.  But sacha Sam rejects Crime-24 - and all hell breaks loose, Ahana (who sells paintings with the helpful tip, \"It'll look beautiful in the house\") abducted with killers dispatched to pack-up Sam. How Sam fights back forms Rush's fun, as do moments like a boss shouting, \"This is a news channel, not an old age home!\", policemen visibly annoyed with pesky reporters asking if they're letting off andhere mein teer, even Pancholi mouthing cliches about how dus mein se aath log sitar-vaadan nahin, triple murder dekhna chahte hain.  But there's bad news too - no amount of lip gloss, nor shiny suits can hide poor acting, which Rush features plenty of. Not one actor bites fully into their role, Hashmi mostly mechanical, the ladies lovely but blank. You fully empathise when Sam, shooting for a breakfast cereal ad, is pleadingly told by the director, \"Sir, please, more feeling ke saath!\" In the second half, Hashmi does wade into the deeper end, exposing a criminal-media nexus - but after too much waffling with cliches, it's too little, too late.  Still, while not the relentless thriller it could've been, Rush offers some slick seconds - the tie-tweaking Sam's face evolving from reporting news to becoming it, Gurgaon's glitz, Pahargunge's grunge, Dhupia's luscious trenches and form-fitted skirts. But despite all that, Rush lacks zip - plus, Hashmi doesn't kiss.  So much for adrenalin, dude.

Like most wars fought between the haves and have-nots, this one is being fought with the police (read administration) on the one hand and the Naxalites on the other - and it's gained gargantuan proportions. Today, this movement is so wide-spread, India and her rulers should no longer adopt an escapist attitude.  Enter the educated and enlightened Jha, who, as is his wont, picks up socially relevant subjects for his cinema. In Chakravyuh, he tackles the Naxalite issue head-on.  The plot revolves around three close friends - Adil (Arjun Rampal), Kabir (Abhay Deol) and Rhea (Esha Gupta) - who get into the police academy together. Hot-headed, rebel-without-a-pause Kabir drops out. His friends Adil and Rhea, also romantically involved, become high-ranking police officials. Kabir re-enters their lives at a college reunion.  The action shifts to Nandighat. Adil is sent here to bring the Naxalites to task - his mission is to capture their charismatic chief, Rajan (Manoj Bajpai).  After several failed attempts, Kabir comes in with an interesting twist to the plot.  Kabir joins the 'enemy' and finds himself confronting several truths that were hitherto hidden from him. He realises that the enemy is not black but grey.  Does the administration have blood on its hands or are the Naxalites being unreasonable? Will Kabir's new-found emotions change his ideology? And will the friends find themselves on opposite sides of the firing line? The personal and professional equations of the two men make for a compelling film with some rock-solid emotions.  Chakravyuh is a hard film to make and marks must be given to Jha for sticking his neck out. Staying true to the subject, he gives us an insight into uncomfortable truths unfolding in our backyard. He is one of the few filmmakers with such audacious work to his credit.  Jha must also be complimented for the scale and performances he has extracted from his lead cast. The men - Manoj, Arjun and Abhay - are compelling; of the girls, Esha starts on a shrill note but improves later. Newbie Anjali Patil shines.

It's a story of a helpless community deciding to stop tolerating the crimes committed against them in the name of caste.  Water is refused to an elderly dalit man, which causes his death; a five-year-old dalit kid is harshly punished because he mouths Om Namah Shivaya; a pregnant dalit woman is forced into bed by an upper caste landlord... Shudra highlights the atrocities committed on dalits in the past and leaves us believing it still happens.  Is caste more important than humanity? How did the caste system come into existence? The film attempts to awaken those who still believe in the age-old casteism blindly.  Shudra is a heart-breaking film. It's emotionally disturbing as all you watch is pain and suffering. The film is more of a documentary on the kind of crimes that were committed on the 'untouchables'. In spite of the film being extremely tragic, it works, as the storytelling and setting is authentic. The actors perform exceptionally well. The outfits, makeup, art direction, cinematography is first-rate. The music is touching and meaningful.  The film however doesn't rise above the depiction of suffering. The awakening part is brief, while the director stresses on the misery. The story could have been much more than a series of tragic tales put together.  Shudra attempts to overthrow the age-old caste system in India. Watch it, if you are still not enlightened enough on the issue.

It starts off as a film intended to spread awareness about the hazards of snake bites. However, what follows is simply unnecessary, overdose of singing and dancing, dated reincarnation drama, cheesy romance and over-the-top performances from the lead cast.  Neelam (Kalpana Pandit) and her gang of aspiring filmmakers are deeply concerned about the number of people in India who die due to snake bites. To do something about it, she, along with her boyfriend (Abrar Zahoor) and friends decide to shoot a film on the issue, in a village, known for its snake population. The moment the gang lands in the isolated village, Neelam realises, 555 years ago, in one of her previous births, she was a snake named Rajini. She dies after being separated from her snake lover, which is why she is reborn as Neelam to seek revenge from the snake charmer who wants Naag Mani (snake pearl).  The film drags, story refuses to proceed. It's not just the reincarnation drama that seems out of place, everything about the film looks dated and unnecessary. You have meaningless songs popping up after every 2 minutes which have nothing to do with the story. The story itself goes haywire. Kalpana Pandit can be seen in almost every scene of the film! The entire film seems like a photo-shoot made to showcase her looks!  The film is full of cliches. You have an old man called 'babaji' instead of 'ramu kaka', you see the actress doing a snake dance at the drop of a hat...list is endless.  Few scenes are dedicated to 'Sridevi', but the film is an ode to Mallika Sherawat's Hisss instead! It's worse in terms of production value.  Janleva 555 is indeed Janleva... it does bore you to death.

The director seems as confused as his protagonist Payal (Shreya Narayan).  Payal is an ambitious, intelligent, courageous girl, who assumes she knows what she wants in life. Payal loves Arun (Chandrachur Singh). She also manages to achieve success in her career. The two get married but love takes a backseat post marriage and so does her hard earned career! Jealousy, insecurity, incompatibility and petty banter leave the two wondering if they'd made the right decision.  Marriage makes Payal lonely and self-critical. She blames herself, considers herself inadequate and incapable of making her husband happy. Co-worker Nirvaan (Sanjau Suri) enters Payal's life and she regains her confidence. Is love a baggage at times?  Prem Mayee has a song where Payal calls herself a Paheli. The entire film is a Paheli of sorts. The director is as confused about what exactly he wanted to show. You keep wondering if both Payal and Arun need to visit the psychologist as they both display weird behaviour. You fear they both suffer from bipolar disorder!  The story had potential but the filmmaker fails to add meaning to it. The film drags and scenes are super repetitive. Chandrachur acts well but needs to lose weight! Sanjay Suri is a savior. He is the reason you can sit through this otherwise boring film. Too bad, he only enters in the second half.  Lead actress Shreya Narayan acts well. Wish she had a better character to play.  Songs are random and don't add anything to the movie. Dialogues are decent.  Prem Mayee is about a girl who feels lost and depressed, unfortunately, that is exactly what you feel after watching this potentially meaningful but meaningless film!

Chakravarthy, Alayana Sharma, Madhu Shalini","Director":"Ram Gopal Varma","Genre":"Horror","Duration":"1 hour 30 minutes","Review":" Ready for a night-walk on a chandni raat? In the same bangla, along the same dark corridors, winding stairways, and dimmed porch - night after night? Then walk into this door. But be forewarned ... Darna zaroori nahin hai! Gettit? Okay, we understand that Ram Gopal Verma is 'possessed' with bhoot-pret (genre), but the problem with this paranormal story (where incidents unfold only between the couple's bedtime and wake-up time) is that everything about it is just plain (in a para) - Normal!  So brave it, don't fear it and read on. Tarun (J.D. Chakravarthy) and Namrata (Manisha Koirala) move into a sprawling bungalow with two kids, Taman (Kushank) and Nimmi (Alayana Sharma), and Tarun's sister, Pooja (Madhu Shalini), the bravest of the lot, joins this bhoot bangla.  Soon, the cliches creep in, even before horror does - with creaky doors, a creakier swing, howling dogs, poonam-ki-raat (every night), a petrified man-servant (with his own share of gaon-ke-ghost stories), wind-chimes, ticking clocks, a scary blonde doll called Dolly (wow! original?), and ghostly artefacts (mostly an animal farm, with figurines of sparrows, bulls, monkeys, dogs and deer). And mind you, it's all in 3D - up, close, and way too close. More on the story now. Soon after they move in, the 6-year-old Nimmi befriends the bhoot (visible only to her), talks and plays with her, all this while the parents believe it's only a part of the child's fantasy world.  Then objects move around, people move around (in super slow motion, mostly up and down the stairs), people scream. Night turns into day. Dogs bark. The bhoot hangs around (sometimes posing for hidden cameras). People scream more. And there it is ... it's time for climax.  In his trademark style, RGV places his camera where no man has gone before (we aren't sure about bhoots) like fan blades, chandeliers, behind stupid-cupid statues, between the legs (of a table), and under a woman's bed-sheet (no surprises, huh?). 'Bhoot Returns', but with no story to tell, until the last twenty minutes, when Ms. Bhoot finally comes out of the closet, and scares for a few seconds. In fact, this wannabe fear-fest is more like a rehash of Ramu's 'Vaastu Shastra', and sadly a far, far stretch from the original 'Bhoot'.  For those with a penchant for 3D films, RGV's exploited the technology impressively in parts. Sandeep Chowta's background music does nothing to heighten the fear psychosis, and we're left with some high-pitched shrill sounds. 'Manisha Returns' too, but must we add, her screams will be far from ecstatic. With little scope to perform, she's trapped between hyperventilating and screeching.  We did leave with one horrifying thought though - of this Bhoot returning (in a third instalment). Hellllppp!!!  "},{"Name":"Makkhi","Release Time":"Feb 9 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Sudeep, Samantha Prabhu, Naveen","Director":"S S Rajamouli","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" South director S S Rajamouli has one of the most envied box office records in Telugu cinema. The eight films he has made across various genres of cinema, including Magadheera(historical drama) to Maryada Ramanna(comic-action) have turned to gold. His Makkhi, earlier released in July 2012 Telegu as Eega and Tamil as Naan ee reached the 100-cr mark in those markets so quickly that it automatically lent itself to being dubbed in Hindi.  movie  The story revolves around Sudeep(Sudeep), an opportunist and skirt-chaser, who will go to any lengths to seek wealth or to get a girl. When he sees a nubile Bindu(Samantha Prabhu), who runs a NGO, Sudeep wants her at any cost. But Bindu has eyes only for her neighbour young Jani(Naveen), a good samaritan. Not accustomed to defeat, Sudeep puts up a continuous chase. He gets Jani out of the way or so it seems till you learn Jani's back. From here on screen proceedings in this revenge drama pep up.  Though the plot is for the most-part predictable, Makkhi still offers situations that are truly gleeful to the young and the old alike. For once, the hero of this film, the fly, a common irritant in all our lives, enjoys our empathy instead of getting our wrath. His quest for revenge, somehow becomes our own battle for justice. As Rajamouli's animated character goes about his business of destroying Sudeep and protecting Bindu; the viewer is ready to willingly go along for the ride. Here one say, had the ride been 15 minutes shorter, it would have been that much more racier. The portion involving a tantrik is pure hog-wash and more suited to a B-grade horror film than here.  But this is a minor irritant in an otherwise enjoyable film.  Ironical it is, that the animated makkhi is so full of life, that he doesn't ever make you miss the presence of a beefy Khan, Kapoor or Kumar. The animation is on par with some of the best in the West and Rajamouli's characterisation of the fly is to be seen to be believed. Makkhi dances as well as Hrithik Roshan and rides as good as Ajay Devgn; mouths dialogue like superstar Rajinikanth and even challenges his rivals to a combat.

Someone who teaches you? Someone who rules you? Or your own inner voice? Chittagong answers this in sensitive style, following Jhunku Roy, the 14-year-old boy-soldier in schoolteacher Surya Sen's historical 1930s uprising against the British. Born to privilege, Jhunku is torn between studying at Oxford and being tutored by District Magistrate Wilkinson (John) versus discovering his own inner self. When his friend is shot dead by vicious Inspector Johnson, Jhunku chooses to join Chittagong's freedom struggle.  Hiwale performs marvelously as Jhunku. Film aficionados will spot the subtle resonances between Hiwale's protagonist and Aparajito's young Apu. But Jhunku is not alone - with a super performance by Siddiqui as Nirmal and Tamotia competent as Priti, Chittagong showcases the courage of extraordinary ordinary folk, fighting against a cruel Raj. Bajpayee presents a tightly restrained performance as 'Master-da' while John captures Wilkinson, trapped between anger and admiration.  The camerawork is remarkable, framing locales like a Japanese painting, hills wreathed in mist, mangroves sunk in water, a Van Gogh-like patchwork of green and yellow fields. It even reflects why the Andaman imprisonment was called 'kala pani' through shots of hopelessly dark waters. The music hops nimbly between yearning and rousing and some sequences - child soldiers fighting machine gun-bearing British troops, Jhunku beaten savagely by British officers in jail - are memorable.  The editing is over-zealous though. Barely do scenes with eye-catching period details start developing - like a tense dinner party at the Wilkinsons' - do they get cut. It takes the second half for the film to show more swagger as Jhunku grows up (played by Vijay Varma, whose angular looks add interest) and returns to Chittagong.  This is a serious film - but far from somber, a tongue-tied Nirmal blushingly telling Priti, \"Mujhe tumhare pyaar karne ki - matlab, larne ki shiddat bahut pasand hai,\" the brigade's youthful high spirits including stripping British guards and making them do utthak-baithak, and finally, the real 'Jhunku' or Subodh Roy talking about his life's most amazing experience. Like a Chittagong orchid, the movie takes time to blossom - but when it does, it's beautiful. And pleases a certain master.

A bored housewife gets attracted to a long lost school friend, who she finds online as she suspects her busy husband to be having an affair with an office colleague.

The star cast is new but not naive when it comes to performance. The youngsters act well. Film is high on drama but also has just the right amount of comedy and suspense that keeps you hooked. On the flip side, editing, dubbing lacks finesse. It could have been better. Cinematography is interesting but the camera moves around a bit too much in circular motion, which is not easy on the eyes.  Login is a youthful film. It's however, not just for the young generation.

Thengdi, Parag Ajgaonkar","Director":"Ujjwal V Thengdi","Genre":"Biopic","Duration":"2 hours 23 minutes","Review":" Well-known Marathi actress Nishigandha Wad essays the role of a lawyer (Sandhya Purushottam), who fights to safeguard the rights and property of poor famers in rural Maharashtra. She is thus conferred the title of 'tai' (elder sister) by the locals, who consider her as their only saviour.  Sandhya (Wad) dares to oppose the politicians and builders, who lure the uneducated famers of Poisar, Maharashtra, into selling their land for less than its market price. Those in power falsely promise the needy, jobs in the factory that would be constructed on their land. Tai sees through the devious intentions of the rich and corrupt. She convinces the farmers to refuse the deal. She takes the matter to court and bravely faces the repercussions of her feisty movement. Other than fighting the political and social storm, tai struggles with her personal life, too.  Sandhya's character has been inspired by slain social activist Navleen Kumar, who worked for the adivasis of Thane district of Maharashtra. For more than a decade, Navleen fought against corrupt politicians and land mafia, using legal intervention. The human rights activist was brutally murdered in 2002. Unfortunately, the film focuses more on her 'alleged' personal life and marital woes. Her fight against injustice seems like a backdrop.  Tai trapped in a marriage that was never consummated, she seeking sexual intimacy in a good friend, she yelling, 'I have full sex appeal' to her impotent husband, she sheepishly flipping through Kama Sutra, a corrupt politician bedding innocent village girls, random item girls showing ample cleavage as they pop up out of nowhere for a dance number... there is a thin line between bold and sleazy and Tai enters the sleazy category when it comes to depicting the alleged personal life of tai, which we are told, is fictional to a certain extent. It all seems like a ploy to attract the front-benchers.  Thengdi terribly loses the plot, especially in the first half. The story goes haywire with random characters making substantial appearances. Scenes begin and end abruptly, thus looking disjointed. An attempt to shuttle between past and present fails too, as everything looks random.  You don't really get to know much about Tai, the person, her beliefs and philosophies. Thengdi, who plays the lead villain (Subodh Singh), is seen more than his protagonist. He however, acts well as the conniving, unethical, politician. What makes Tai, the iron lady, different from the rest and her journey is missing.  Nishigandha Wad acts well. She provides dignity to a film that borders on being titillating in most segments. She is the reason you hope the film will take off somewhere, and it does in the second half to a small extent. The film eventually focuses solely on the issue you go looking for to begin with, but only in the last few minutes! The dialogues are not strong enough either.

Minus Chandni Chowk and chaat, baraats and bhangra, lassi and ladkis. Not that there's anything wrong with Delhi a few shades duller, but the film starts out on an interesting premise, and rolls onto the beaten track, riddled with characters and climaxes that are mediocre and mundane. Set in a ghostly abandoned mine, that has only an impoverished couple Bhanu (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) and Saroj(Saba Joshi), and a junked bull-dozer for company, the story revisits an age-old saga. Of land politics, poor suppressed by the rich, fight for love against power, Pajeros running over poverty lines, sweat of labour (with no dignity), cracked heels and a crumbling society. Bhanu's inherited his father's lowly legacy, of being the sole watch-guard to a mine (with a laathi for a weapon) that's turned into barren land. His only ambition is maalik ka seva (or lets' say ghulami) even if it's at the cost of stripping his dignity and trading his soul. Talk about selling the soul, his maalik, Lakshmichand (Avatar Sahani), is a tyrannical, cold-hearted SOB (son of a *****) who won't cringe before selling his daughter to another older SOB, or hiring contract killers, or raping a bechari nari. Throw in a stereo-typical corrupt cop, lovers on-the- run, a masked murderer and a bloody chain of events.  Dibyendu Bhattacharya convincingly plays a character who is deprived (of dignity and dimes), oppressed by the bullying boss and victimized by his ill-fate. His performance wins a vote of sympathy. Saba Joshi, fierce in flashes, is the only sight to the sore eyes in this dusty drama. Avatar Sahani, evokes rage with his brutality, mean streak, and blurred bare-butt scenes.  Director, Sidharth Srinivasan, packs in everything that an Amiri-Garibi story is made of, with cliched metaphors, tiring twists, gaalis and gore. There are moments where you empathize with the characters, and you're waiting for the idea to germinate, but it gets 'trampled' along the way.  This one isn't a 'class' apart.

Neither will any part of you feel like giving it a standing ovation. This is as much of a dhoka, as the slang version of KLPD actually suggests. It is a string of episodes, part slap-stick, part-ridiculous, part comedy (the smallest part, of course) that all happens in one long night. It starts right here.  At a fashion show called En'gay'ged 377 (corny!) hosted by legendary 'man-eater', Rohit Pichwadia (hinting at some back-door activity, if you didn't get it), where Lucky (Vivek Oberoi) lands up to help his buddy shoot the event. He ends up spiking drinks by peeing into it (say it... yucks!), and falling for Lovina (Mallika Sherawat). He follows her into the night, where one by one the nocturnal crazy creatures crawl out, trapping Lucky in a web of madcap situations and silly shenanigans. He is on-the-run, and everyone is out to get him (laid too).  There's a group of local Jat-goons headed by Kaptaan(Ashutosh Rana), clueless cops, and sons of sardars doing their usual band-baaja-bhangra.

In fact, she's so good in her sweetmeat that she even markets it.  But one skill that Shashi lacks is speaking English. This makes her the constant butt of jokes and rebuttal with her husband (Adil Hussain) and teenage daughter (Navika Kotia). The film drives home the point that those who speak English fluently usually adapt a condescending attitude towards those who don't.  movie  Mind you; Shashi is not your average Jane. When opportunity takes her to New York for a niece's wedding; the sari-clad Shashi, steals a few hours each day and enrolls for a four-week crash course in English.  Here begins a hilarious yet heart-rending tale where Shashi and a motley bunch of a Spanish nanny, Eva (Ruth Aguilar); a Tamil software engineer, Rama (Rajeev Ravindranathan), a Chinese beautician, Yu Son (Maria Romano), a French cook, Laurent (Mehdi Nebbou), and a Pakistani cabbie, Salman Khan (Sumeet Vyas), an African dancer, Udumbke (Damian Thompson) guided by an English tutor, David (Cory Hibbs) show you spunk and determination which can help you overcome obstacles anytime or anywhere.  The students of the English class also act as a support system to the protagonist, who despite her own dedication, finds that complacency has slipped into her marriage and there's self-respect lacking in her relationship with her teenage daughter.  In Laurent, the Frenchman's attraction for her, Shashi rediscovers her own self-worth. Equipped with his attention and her now newfound knowledge of English, she finds wings to soar.  Easily one of the best films of 2012; is tale of women empowerment (actually it is bound to empower every viewer) because it strikes a chord, right from the start to the end titles.  Debutant Gauri Shinde, who made advertising films before she ventured into the feature area; proves she's an ace cinema writer-director. The result is a sweet, sensitive and superlative film that makes you laugh, cry and smile. Every emotion is identifiable, every nuance is balanced. The characters are real, the performances effortless.  Amit Trivedi's music is hummable. The title track, Gustak dil, the Marathi remixes of the Navrai Mazhi; all of it is mesmerising. The beauty of the soundtrack is that flows naturally, without disturbing the narrative. Trivedi's track also gets you to question—why other mainstream filmmakers—make such a song-`n'-dance of bawdy lyrics and item songs, when there is such joy in simplicity.  Sridevi is the backbone of EV. Anxiety, anger, arrogance, anguish, attraction, the actress conveys emotions effortlessly with or without words. Returning to the silver screen after a 15-year hiatus; Sri's performance here is a master-class for actors. So much so, that you keep applauding her, long after the lights come on. One must also put in a word of praise for the performances of Sri's son-Sagar (Shivansh Kotia); an adorable moppet who you want to take home with you. And her ma-in-law, Mrs Godbole (Sulabha Deshpande); a delight to watch, as always.

An almost-rural setting. 2. A medley of whimsical character artists. 3. A complex, chaotic parivaar choc-o-bloc with more betas, betis, chachas and chamchas than TV-Land's epic shows. 4. Stupidly, strictly, slapsticky. 5. A parallel romantic sidetrack that contributes one sugary spoonful-of-story to this mash-up. 6. A crazed-ending where everyone (from star-to-junior-artiste-to clapper-boy) appears in a mad-melodrama called 'Priyan's Climax'... Aaah! KDM makes all these 'checks' - Yes! Priyan and his motley crew are back, but this plough of his only reproduces a bad crop.  Rewind to two friends, David (Om Puri) and Peter's (Paresh Rawal)fallout, where David went on to marry Mary (Peter's sweetheart), and they both settled in the same damned village; with the burning issue being a 22-carat gold 'cross' stolen from the church (for Christ's sake!). David's son, Johnny (Shreyas), called Bakri by all (since he lacks 'balls' and bheja; bleat, bleat!), is in love with Peter's daughter, Maria (Madhhurima), who has a female bodyguard called Bulbul Pehelwan(Pratima Kazmi), total Dabangg Sallu-style. And while his cranky, overworked baap digs away (like a Mumbai BMC labourer on a normal day) at the barren land; Bakri dreams of being a crorepati soon, by collecting lottery tickets. Enter the silent, brooding, hungry-man-with-no-name (Nana Patekar), who is probably David's long-lost son (Amen!) or maybe not? He eats like a beast and digs like miner (probably looking for missing parts of this script); dramatically changing the lives of all the Davids, Peters, Repeaters, Bakris and Bulbuls here. Good Lord bless our popcorn!  One thing Priyadarshan doesn't do is 'lose the plot' here; simply because there isn't one to begin with. With cliched humour that forces more yawns than laughs; blah-lines; Oddball characters and OTT situations; and of course the quintessential item number (Anjana Sukhani) that adds to the fizzle (Cross-our-hearts-and-hope-to-fry).  Shreyas's character is spineless but he does his best to 'back' it. Nevertheless, with such a weak story there's nothing that can help him win a jackpot. Om Puri attempts to 'bear the cross', but there's no redemption. Nana Patekar puts up a tough-guy act (when was the last time he didn't?) and walks through the film with a few dialogues (guess, there's nothing more to say) and a deadpan expression. Paresh Rawal is completely wasted.  Our suggestion? Skip it. And save yourself from becoming a bakra.

Akshay Kumar plays a small and sacred role but OMG is largely powered by Rawal's performance as Kanjilal Mehta, a cynical Gujarati shopkeeper in Mumbai's Chor Bazaar, hardcore atheist who merrily dupes the believing into buying Krishna statues before whom Kanji trills, \"Kootchie kootchie, natkhat!\" The atheist even disrupts a matki phoro ceremony for Krishna where, despite a cracking guest performance by Sonakshi Sinha and Prabhudeva to 'Go-Go-Go-Govinda' - watch the latter's buttery moves and the former's rock-chick hair - Kanjilal rains on the party.  movie  An earthquake follows, reducing just one shop to rubble - Kanjilal's. His insurance company refuses to pay, citing an act of God. Facing ruin, Kanji takes God - as represented by 'collection officers', religious leaders Swami Leeladhar (Chakrabarty, super), Siddheshwar (Namdeo, hamming it up to Italian deli-level) and sexy sanyasin Mata Gopi (Poonam Jhawar) - to court demanding compensation. Goons try to kill Kanji - but 'consultant' Krishna Vasudev Yadav saves him via a thrilling motorbike ride - then moves into his house. The trial circles deep philosophy, yet tongues stay firmly in cheek as Kanji tells the outraged swamis, \"Ye mujhe kya Gita sikhayenge - inka IQ room temperature se bhi low hai.\"  Rawal is pure pleasure when he naughtily points out, \"Recession mein toh inka dhanda double ho jata hai!\", when debating being boiled in oil down in hell, he asks, \"Mein aadmi hoon ya pakora?\" or, when he states that such religion - superstition, fear, ignorance - \"insaan ko bebas ya aatankwadi banata hai.\" It is far better, he remarks, to donate milk to the hungry than pour it over a shrine - and into a drain, to give to the needy rather than enrich religious commerce working on human weakness and woe via 'exchange offers' with the divine.  Rawal's conviction is OMG's bedrock - but its beauty comes from his dynamics with Krishna (Kumar, channeling a Twilight-like zone of motorbikes, overcoats and chiseled looks), who saves his life, educates him via sacred texts and gently instructs an annoyed housewife yelling Kanji is a nastik to eat her ice-cream before it melts. Few Bollywood actors do loopy-plus-hot as well as Kumar and he's silken here, all delicate hints and half-smiles, smoothly playing the flute as Kanji shouts, \"O Hari Prasad! O Chaurasia!\"  Their chemistry is electric, Rawal wryly noting, \"Suit-boot mein aya Kanhaiya\", backed by Chakrabarty too, biting into the role of a long-haired swami speaking in softly mincing tones, using his hands down to one finger in a terrific take-off. Other acting (Puri, a Muslim lawyer helping Kanji, Manjrekar as lawyer Sardesai, Lubna Salim as Kanji's wide-eyed wife Susheela) is strictly average but covered by an astonishingly good background track pepping up the pace, adding zing but never distracting from a complex story told in a simple way.  On the downside, OMG's production values are not high-gloss and it sags and looks stagey at times. Importantly though, in a nation obsessed with taweezes and tonsures, fasts and fasaads, the symbolic over the sensible, OMG conveys a serious message this festive season - God is to be found in human beings. And, rather like Hindi films of an earlier age, it does so in a light and unusual way.  Hallelujah.

His Chandni Bar (2001) dealt with Mumbai dance-bars; Page-3 (2005) showed the shallow side of the media and celebrity circus;  Fashion(2008) dealt with the seamier side of the fashion industry. And one must say here that in each of his previous works Madhur was far more in control of proceedings than he is in Heroine; a film that superficially traces Bollywood's underbelly.  movie  The protagonist is Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor), a superstar, who has the world at her feet for a bit in the beginning of this film. Unfortunately she is also fashionably diagnosed with the bipolar syndrome and is happy to destroy herself in her various relationships.  If you are wondering why Sunshine Girl Mahi is on a constant emotional roller-coaster; the narrative tells you that she has had a messed up childhood and hence she has developed this masochistic streak.  So on the one hand, Mahi is cutting ribbons, and shooting for a dozen endorsements. But quickly enough she is also threatened by the arrival of the younger actresses and awards that go missing. To add to her woes, she's drawn like a moth to a flame to her married co-star Aryan Khanna(Arjun Rampal); a cad.  Very clearly the written material at hand draws from unflattering accounts of various real and reel Hindi film heroines of the 80s (unfair to name them because a couple of them are not even around to defend themselves); who were in messy situations with their married co-stars.  In a bid to pack in every piece of studio gossip ever heard; Heroine makes Mahi swing from a relationship with a married actor to another with a successful cricketer (Randeep Hooda). Cloning stereotypes of what the middle-class call a liberated; Mahi is also shown smoking, drinking and popping pills so frequently; she seems more like a social hazard than a free-thinking girl.  The film is made enjoyable by some pithy dialogue credited to Niranjan Iyengar.

My strongest objection to it is its extreme violence in language. Foul-mouthed films aren't new. Filmmakers often use cussing for shock-value, rude energy and to add believability to scenarios. Godard's done it. Kubrick's done it, on occasion, Anurag Kashyap too. But in JHTTD, expletives are used with a mindboggling frequency that actually makes the film's dialogues totally unbelievable - and unacceptable. Chu****, ma-or-behen****? Baby-talk for JHTTD, clearly hoping a thin storyline, weak acting, shaky music and ridiculous situations can be masked by doling gross abuse all over these.  The film is also reprehensible for portraying Biharis in their worst stereotypes. Criminal-minded, sex-starved and abhorrently filthy are apparently only some shades to Biharis - here, gangsters Chandrabhan (Kishen), Atka (Vatsalya), Mahkoo (Sharma) and Bitwa (Kumar). The foursome, making just enough to enjoy item numbers that heave 'Palangtor jawani', get hired by local cop Hanumant Singh (Sharma, usually eye-catching, overshadowed by the squelching abuse here) for a hit-job in Mumbai. Haryanvi arms dealer Rana (Saxena, entirely unconvincing) wishes to take revenge on Maratha media mogul Pawar (Namdev - ditto) by having his daughter Srishti (Crowney, pleasantly unfettered by any need to act) killed.  The Biharis reach Dadar station - a remarkably uncouth attempt at comedy involving masturbation occurs here - and Pawar's home where Chandru falls in love with Srishti. Her father, amazingly, sacks the other help and employs the four felons to guard and live with her alone. She prances about wearing a towel and making salad for them, the latter trying to shoot her and repeatedly failing. The frustration grows.  As does the viewer's revulsion to what might've been a passable plot, but gets utterly subsumed by intricately foul swearwords. The few snatches of music are welcome not for any quality but the break they give one's ears from the dialogue.  Kishen is club-like, both heavy and wooden. Vatsalya presents a creepy performance but is so muddy-mouthed, you don't care. Sharma's hit an unimaginable low while some little comedy is provided unintentionally by Kalsekar, the IG who growls, \"If you can't save the innocent, always kill the bastard.\"  As JHTTD finally closes with more mud, blood, even a possible rape, you're repulsed at this massacre of a movie. Why the star? For the two words which made this film bearable - the end.  "},{"Name":"Barfi!","Release Time":"Feb 9 2016","Critic rating":"4.0/5","Cast":"Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Ileana D’Cruz","Director":"Anurag Basu","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 30 minutes","Review":" He was born to a song playing on a Murphy radio, but this 'Murphy' baby (Ranbir) aka Barfi has a different law. Everything that has to go wrong will go wrong, but not if you brave it with a broad smiley. So 'mute' the high decibel chaos and deafening melodrama around and tune into Barfi ki duniya; which is simple, sweet and SILENT! Yet, extreme emotions of love, joy and pain resound - at different 'frequencies'.  In the breathtakingly beautiful Darjeeling of the 70s, Barfi 'bumps into' Shruti (Ileana) and instantly falls in love with her. With wonder-eyes and in part-Chaplin-part-Raj-Kapoor style, he woos her with more 'actions' than words and leaves her speechless. He even wins over her heart, but she walks away with a Bengali babu, only because he 'apparently' has some abilities (of sound and speech, minus emotion) that Barfi isn't blessed with.  movie  But don't worry, this Charlie is no bechara, he gives her a wordless, guttural, 'earful', wears his signature smiley and moves on. Soon he reunites with childhood friend Jhilmil (Priyanka) - autistic and abandoned by her wealthy family to live in a 'special' home.  In between haath-rickshaw rides, watching fireflies and gulping putchkas - an endearing and special bond grows between Barfi and Jhilmil. Life takes a turn (sharper than the tram-lines of Kolkata), and the destinies of Barfi, Jhilmil and Shruti mysteriously converge.  Ranbir, in the most challenging performance of his career, leaves us 'dumbstruck'. Without use of conventional crutches of cool-catchphrases, dhamaakedar-dialogbaazi, bare-bodies, and other 'items'; he stuns you in every single frame. Even too much of Barfi isn't enough, damn the diet!  For Priyanka, there's only one word - Bravo! In a role where she needs to under-emote, she does so brilliantly. Without stylish chiffons, she wears awkward frocks, buckle-shoes and buck teeth, discarding the diva image like an old hand-me-down for lesser actresses; delivering an incredible performance.  Ileana looks a beautiful Bong bahu, and proves her talent with conviction and confidence in her Bollywood debut.  For a story riddled with disabilities, Barfi is more than ably handled by Anurag Basu. He remarkably immerses you in his world of sounds and verbose silences, recreating Chaplin's antics, stripping two superstars down to basics and sensitively spinning a magical world of unconditional love. The narrative is too non-linear at times, and the pace slows in the second half. That apart, it's truly path-breaking for Bollywood.  Pritam's background score fills the air, lending support to silences, and the lyrics beautifully describe the mute-musings of the characters. The biggest human disability is we can't find happiness. So go indulge in Barfi! It'll leave you 'happy high'!

They're killed at birth or even before they're born. That's dramatic enough for a disturbing movie to be made. Only, it must be made well.  This one shows the struggle of lawyer-plus-NGO worker Anita (Debnath, enthusiastic but saddled with few expressions and excessive dubbing) against the riwayat or custom in village Gangapur - and her own marital family - of murdering girl children, considered liabilities. Anita takes on cook Radha's drunken husband Gangaram (Lakhia, mostly vague, forceful in one scene involving a baby), an unbothered village doctor (Gupta, convincing in his apathy), a callous police force, a sleazy sarpanch and her own control freak father-in-law (Dubey, notable as a regressive elder) whose insistence on male grandchildren wrecks his elder son Dipak (Ankola, picturesque, yet blank) and Dipika's (Kaur) marriage.  After several abortions, the latter's an alcoholic wreck, wearing eye-catching saris and spewing whiskey fumes at her husband. Anita's own husband Raj (Siddique, nice looks, weak acting) is also becoming a wobbling wimp before Big Daddy - but a catastrophe changes everything. Meanwhile, Anita must defend Gangaram in court - while expecting her own girl child.  Here's the trouble. Rewaiyat loses steam huffing and puffing between all these characters and sub-plots. If it stuck to one central location - Gangapur, all stunning blue-green foliage, dark, rainy nights, stifling poverty, frightening views on infanticide, with shocking shots of a bloodied baby - it would have far greater dramatic impact. Instead, the film careens about, accommodating Anita's sasurji's wisecracks - \"Hum honeymoon ke liye Amarika gaye the - tum Gangapur?\", her assistant's sad story recounted while driving a jeep called 'NGO', etc. And it sags, becoming loose over an unnecessary 40 minutes.  Dramatic music would've helped but it's missing. So is acting with depth and taut direction. All of which is a pity. This film should have only highlighted missing girl children - not anything else MIA.

That it's nobody's 'keep' - but everybody's 'mistress'. Easily seduced by the next hot number on the bloc. Sometimes it walks away silently into the dark night, but mostly it screams like multiple orgasms in the vanity van. Shanaya (Bipasha Basu) is a top star who is gradually falling off the dizzying heights of stardom, while hot new aspirant Sanjana (Esha Gupta) is sweeping away movies, awards and the coveted top spot. In denial of her waning career, the self-obsessed and fiercely ambitious Shanaya will do anything to cling to the last fringes of her career. Even if that means risking love, manipulating her director boyfriend, Aditya (Emraan Hashmi) and losing Godly faith. She moves over to the dark side - of Kali Vidya (black magic), tantra-mantra, meeting (and mating) with aatmas and seducing her boyfriend into becoming partner-in-crime, with a lot of jism show, sex (and dialogues like, \"If you love me you can be stupid for me!\" Bah!). Sanjana is haunted by spells of black magic, and in between shrieks, screams (and yeah, steamy sex too, courtesy Aditya) she loses her mind and heart. Throw in a bhatakti aatma (Manish Chaudhury) and some shocks, shivers and songs - and there you have the third part of the Raaz series.  movie  With a storyline that's fairly simple with one-dimensional characters, Vikram Bhatt, dishes out this horror show (which turns 'horny' as hell at times) in 3D, with glossy production values (and cliched elements like the usual fog, kabrastans and howling voiceovers aplenty), dollops of sex, horror and a few terrifying scenes. The 3D effect isn't state-of-the-art, but a few innovative scenes impress. The music, however, is disappointing for a Bhatt film, with songs used as patches between insignificant scenes.  Bipasha looks scarily stunning in this role with only one shade - deep, dark black. It's a challenge and she takes it on with a vengeance. Emraan, shows different shades, but in the struggle between pecks, passion and possession he comes across as a confused soul. Esha Gupta is an attractive package and strikes in emotional scenes (when she's not shrieking, that is).  For all those who want to move over from the Ramsay Bros... go watch 'Raaz 3' in 3D, at your own risk. But don't take it to your grave.

You'll love it or hate it. It's a totally off-the-wall entertainer powered by corny jokes, OTT filmi characters and tongue-in-cheek sequences. If you like that sort of thing, you'll laugh out loud. If you don't, it's not for you.  Joker starts with scientist Agastya (Kumar) who's developing 'the world's most sophisticated radio' to contact aliens, urgently summoned from America to his desi village. With girlfriend Diva (Sinha), Agastya returns to his roots in - get this - Paglapur, a swampy village that belongs to no Indian state since the British officer mapping it vamoosed when the nation's largest madhouse broke into the place. The result - Paglapur was settled by the deranged and their descendants, self-sufficient till a dam pops up, choking off its water, the reason Agastya's called back by his desperate desis including bro Babban (Talpade) who only speaks gobbledygook, his cross-eyed father and the red-coated progeny of an English lunatic called 'Lord Falkland'.  movie  Agasyta approaches several ministers for help but receiving only snide jokes, 'Sattu' turns the joke on the world and decides Paglapur is where aliens will land. As 'UFOs' - or, as Agastya shouts, \"Haan haan, FO!\" - descend, the world's press, politicians and goodies, from electricity to phones, reach Paglapur. As does Agastya's nemesis, nasty American scientist, the brilliantly-named Simon Goeback (O'Nell), who sets out to ruin the village's show.  Joker is literally a mad comedy, its real star its jokes, one villager stating calmly, \"Dil toh karta hai ki qawalli gaun\", another explaining an alien in a field as, \"Babuji lota lekar gaye honge,\" glittering little gems in a crazy painting. Some performances - Talpade especially, O'Nell too - are stand-out while Kumar is adequate. Sinha makes a pretty picture but has a pinched role, Paglapur peculiarly not having any other women around. Joker's plot is inventive, inspired by a colourful mix, ET to Lagaan, Harry Potter, Peepli Live, even reminiscent of an Asterix comic where at the end, they find oil. It's satirical - the old madhouse gets turned into the 'Paglapur Laaj', its electric-shock room becoming the 'Presidential Suite' - and oddball, gaon-walas wearing their dhotis with Trilby hats.  But cheekiness aside, it's got flaws. Apart from 'Kaafirana' and 'Sing Raja', it has unmemorable music and its lighting provides a dim, aquarium-like viewing experience. Agastya's boss is a mysteriously flickering 3D-like image, Diva's scarlet nail polish appears and vanishes as rapidly as the village ET, the film's FX looks more tacky than techie. Quibbles aside, it's a funny flick which doesn't promise the earth - but delivers a home- made alien.

Hiding a clean, shiny bald pate, of course. And if you're 40-something, single -not-ready-to-mingle, a struggling writer trying to model yourself on something between Ram and Raja Harishchandra - life ain't easy. That's Shubhendu Roy. His shocking alter ego is roommate Gagan (Ranvir Shorey), a struggling actor and compulsive liar, who can fake anything (pun intended) and believes in jhoot ki jeet. But then, Bald meets Beautiful and all hell breaks loose. Shubhendu meets wannabe beauty queen Kanak (Manjari Fadnis) in an online chat-room, and overnight his life spirals into a 'web' of lies. He's suddenly a 24-year-old, writing films for the Chopras and Johars, with a six-pack, sex-appeal, and soccer stars like Maradona and Beckham for friends. Liar! Liar!  Likewise, Gagan is busy wooing Sheila (Neha Dhupia), who flaunts her jawaani with item songs like Tan Mein Jalan. Adding colourful drama, there's a sleazy filmmaker, Nayan Sidhwani (Saurabh Shukla) who's more of a don than a director, flanked by his vampish arm-candy(Lillete Dubey) and a part-time-waiter-part-time-actor (Vijay Raaz), who heighten the chaos.  With a bit of truth, a bit of lies, part spoof, part-real, Saurabh Shukla spins this romcom with witty one-liners, few hilarious scenes, good comic timing, a lot energy (sometimes excessive). But the second half loses spirit, with stretched scenes, repetitive humour and sums-up with an anti-climax. Infact, we even wonder why the movie is called 'I M 24', really?  As a 42-year old moonlighting as 24-year-old stud, Rajat Kapoor is amusing, but loses grip mid-way. Ranvir Shorey, with his caricaturish Kung-Fu moves, and hyper, high-pitched performance is the highlight. Neha Dhupia and Manjari Fadnis add glamour and giggles.  This '24-something' keeps floundering in the pre-teen sense-of-humour space, never really coming of age.

Of deep mysteries, shattering myths, daayans, horrifying beliefs, dusty roads, parched lands and dried ponds. But our desi Alice, Shreya (Lehar Khan) is all set to encounter her fairy-tale dream, albeit in India's hinterlands. Shreya, with her kid-bro Sam (Krishang Trivedi), land in their father, Dev's (Pravin Dabas) village for the first time, unaware that their adventures and misadventures will change the fate of a village that's sinking (ironically, without a water-body in sight) in its self-afflicted misery. Shreya is one of a kind (she calls her father Dev, and refuses to wear anything girlie); she's the only tomboy this backward village has ever seen, where women are as 'covered-up' as their deep dark secrets. With brother-in-tow, she wanders like a local gaon ki chhori, meets villagers whose mindsets are narrower than local gullis, befriends and bullies the local boys (Harsh Mayar), beats them at their games and finally crosses the most dreaded, 'No Entry' zone - the daayan's haveli. On the other side, she unearths the real story, where there's nothing puritan or pari-like. And too much water has run dry already.  Lehar Khan, with abundant enthusiasm and terrific confidence is quite the hero of this adventure. Krishang Trivedi adds dollops of cuteness, and Harsh Mayar adapts perfectly to this rural-setting and is entertaining as the gaon-ka-chhota-gunda. Parvin Dabas as the single father holds fort with his tempered performance. Tannishtha Chatterjee, as a maid, throws in her Bonglish with ease and innocence.  Director, Nila Madhab Panda (known for the much-acclaimed 'I Am Kalam'), adeptly weaves in a stirring social message, adds a bit of mystery, folklore and suspense, without sermonizing. Though in the second half, the imagination dries up and most scenes are predictable. The eerie silences are punctuated by Midival Punditz & Ashish Chauhan's music, adding a rustic flavour  Dive into this adventure, you'll find mermaids and much more.

Young British traveler Jasper (Williams) lands between both sides when, staying with the Bhatias, he loses lakhs from his luggage. The Bhatias blame their servants but the help hasn't done it and scrambles desperately to raise the money and avoid the police.  DIAD depicts how, despite its farmhouses, glittering cars and beautiful socialites, Delhi is a city that's merciless to its poor, the rich sleeping in air-conditioned mansions, their servants in holes in the wall, struggling to derive some comfort from the drudgery of their lives. DIAD features strong performances from Williams, Kharbanda and Dubey, the desi duo a perfect portrait of a nouveau-riche Punjabi pair for whom 'Continental cuisine' is 'macaroni ya pizza', cook Udai (eye-catching Singh) comparing them bitterly to his coq-au-vin-preferring previous sahib.  The domestic help presents a compelling, if not always convincing picture, poignant but prone, Patil particularly, to overdoing the wretchedness. And while the film has little gems - Mukund calling Kalpana 'seeti', offering 'rosy wine' - it also suffers problems. Like a Monsoon Wedding hangover, causing characters to hop from Mehrauli to Old Delhi in a snap, just so we can enjoy yet another shot of the Jama Masjid. The hangover holds DIAD - otherwise featuring fun little sequences including Jasper discovering no toilet paper - from developing with full confidence.  Yet, it captures the awful quality of life Delhi's domestics have, leaving you afraid to ask what Rohini undergoes at a moneylender's one night. That tension even distracts from the mystery of why Banerjee's wasted in a compressed role or where the dog from the film's start vanishes thereon. With few tracks, more music could've helped DIAD come into its own, instead of repetitive shots of labourers erecting a shamiana, over which my puzzled neighbour in the hall finally asked, \"Par ye lagaya kyun tha?\" Still, DIAD has small problems but works as a big-hearted story, Jasper eventually leaving Delhi suffering a loss - but Rohini regaining something. It's hard to depict a world where jharus and jazz co-exist. DIAD does that, hesitant but sensitive all the way.

Your style? Push-ups, satin, lace?

So when a '36B' Shirin Fuggawala (Farah Khan) ambles into his store, his heart uplifts like a 'wonderbra' for the first time; and he knows he's finally found his 'size'. Or like mommie (Daisy Irani) says, \"Farhad ka murga jaaga!\" While he's a pro at 'sizing' up women, Farhad is clueless about the As and Bs of romance.

In ETT, the montages pass quickly. A voice-over tells you of how Governments fight shadow battles of espionage and intrigue with faceless agents.  movie  Cut to India's finest RAW (Research & Analysis Wing) agents Tiger--Salman Khan. He enters the screen, dramatically, shoes first, kicking butt in a crowded bazaar; with his trade-mark checked scarf around his neck. He ambushes a handful of traitors single-handedly in a long-drawn high octane action sequence that is clearly inspired by Jason Bourne(Bourne Identity/Supremacy series) and James Bond (Quantum of Solace). Mission one successfully completed Tiger returns home to a middle-class neighbourhood in New Delhi.  Barely have his wounds from Iraq healed when his boss, Girish Karnad, (impressive performance) packs him of to Ireland to spy on a professor (Roshan Seth) who may be trading missile technology secrets with Pakistan.  Before he sets out, the boss ominously warns Tiger how agents must never let their hearts rule their head. But when Cupid strikes even Tigers become pussy-cats. The spy is drawn to college girl Zoya(Katrina Kaif) and he's almost ready to settle down with her, when the twist in the plot is revealed. Kat is a secret agent for the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence); she owes allegiance to India's archenemy Pakistan.  Post interval, ETT goes on to focus on the Tiger-Zoya romance. Since they have unfinished business, the plot allows them to lock eyes at a peace summit in Istanbul. Passions are rekindled. This time they let their own feelings rule and elope. Chased by their own people and the enemy, the couple traipse in Cuba and other foreign locales, riding bikes and cuddling up while some lack-lustre songs play in the backdrop. One must say there is nothing raw about the Kat-Sallu romance in ETT; it's synthetic.  Leaving the plot open for a sequel, just in case Salman's fans demand one; ETT ends with telling you how Tiger's file went missing because, once this super-spy decided to go off the radar, no intelligence agency could actually track him down.

Sometimes it's better never than late. That's precisely the case with this Bollywood film which should have never made it to the screens. Overtime has been caught in a time wrap for quite some time - its release has been postponed for days, weeks and even months. But then that's not the reason why this one looks all stale. Topicality is no issue here - casting couch, women exploitation.... There is a bigger problem. The story is missing. The acting is missing. The continuity of scene is missing. The clothes (skimpily clad girls) are missing. The only thing that's there in aplenty are the songs, a huge cast, the 'c' word...

This time it's double the dollops of gore; two much. Booming guns and metal-shredded innards spilling gut onto the streets. More revenge and rage. More gangs and more bangs (some pistols firing from lungi covered groins) and more man-power. With every shade of red, black and grey - deeper and bolder. Faizal Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), son of Sardar Khan (played by Manoj Bajpai in 'GOW I') inherits an unforgiving past, where his father was gruesomely cut down by a rival gang. After a series of shocking killings of his kin (mourning to the tunes of brass-bands playing 'Yaad teri aayegi' with jhankar beats), and his mother's (Richa Chaddha)forceful instigation, the pothead 'snorts' out of his stupor, and gets 'cracking', literally. He takes over as head of the family, and catapults into becoming the most powerful and dreaded man of Wasseypur. His addiction is now 'blood' - Ramadhir Singh's (Tigmanshu Dhulia) blood. And no amount of arsenal is enough to quench this blood-lust. Soon this revenge riot turns into a ruthless rampage, through dealings in illegal scrap trade, election rigging and hooliganism.  movie  That's the dark side of it all. On the lighter side, amidst all the blood-thirst, there's some ishq-vishq too (no, the location doesn't move to Cape Town, and no Parisian stylists and designers are flown down). It's as real and raw as Faizal telling his love interest, Mohsina (Huma Qureshi) who's addicted to everything Bollywood, 'Main tumhare saath sex karna chahta hoon', while she watches Mamta Kulkarni seduce Akshay Kumar on TV. Or even better, every time Faizal's spirit tempers down, Mohsina sweetly rocks him to her Bollywood lullaby ... 'Joh bhi wrongwa hai...rightwa karoji'. 'Uh Awww'!  Director, Anurag Kashyap's culmination to this gang-saga is as bloody as the first (if not more); yet it's an easier watch. The story is astutely interspersed with bursts of music (Bihari folkish tunes with a modern twist), humour (crass and rural), high drama and sudden relief - like a sexual climaxing. Even with a high quotient of brutal violence and moral assassination, Kashyap keeps his sense of humour (mostly black) intact, and entertains. With characters named 'Perpendicular', 'Definite' (Zeishan Quadri), 'Tangent' - he truly defies all tiresomely tried-and-tested formulas of filmmaking in Bollywood with his 'big bang-bang theory'. Though in spurts, it unleashes scenes that make you crack up, in true Bollywood style humour. Wasseypur is not devoid of star-struck fans, with gangsters and locals walking and talking like a deadly Dutt or a super cool Salman, peppered with dialogues like 'Hindustan mein jab tak cinema hai, log ch***ya bante rahenge'.  Nawazuddin Siddiqui spells doom, is devious and highly-dramatic - yet you take to his character almost instantly. He brilliantly blazes through this role, from being as strong or as shallow as his character demands. Huma Qureshi, with her gaudy clothes, designer sun-glasses and unusual attractiveness is the hottest cheez in Wasseypur. She beautifully lends support as a powerful man's 'prouder' better-half, even in his worst crimes. Richa Chaddha holds fort in the sequel too, strong and poised, she's fab. Zeishan Quadri makes a mark, most 'Definite'ly.  With excellent performances, a screenplay that's strung together beautifully (Zeishan Quadri, Akhilesh, Sachin Ladia, Anurag Kashyap) a revenge story that touches a dramatic crescendo and music that plays out perfectly in sync with tragic twists of tale - 'GOW II' is an interesting watch, for the brave-hearted. Like the first part, the movie slows down at times (with pointless pistols, hordes of characters and wasted sub-plots); the length needs to be shot down desperately.  But otherwise, it's revenge on a platter - served cold (heartedly) and definitely worth a 'second' helping.

If you know the answers to these profound questions asked in Amar Prem years ago, we pray, tell us too, please! Almost four decades later, Amar Prem's maker Shakti Samanta's grandson Aditya Samanta arrives in a movie called Yeh Jo Mohabbat Hai in the hope of recreating the magic of Shaktida. However, this germ of an idea remains that, a germ. Never really sprouting into an idea, sirji. What is obvious is the complete lack of it. Making this an almost unbearable watch. Even 'Pushpa's (made legendary by Rajesh Khanna) tears would have frozen on seeing this non-amar prem kahani. Karan Choudhury (Aditya Samanta) and Karishma Rathore (Nazia Hussain) are meant to be together (guess what ... they were born on the same day. So original na?) until their warring families do them part. In the city of Udaipur, the age-old battle (of blood and business) between the Choudhury and Rathore families; is as popular as the purani hawelis and panoramic palaces.  Karan and Karishma meet at Krakow University (Poland), and after (predictably) bumping into each at jogging tracks (she skates into his arms. Ooof!) and ice-cream trucks, they fall in love (obviously making complete use of Poland's topography in song sequences). Oh yes, there's more. Some more forgettable songs, (sweet) nothings, (laughable) lover's tiffs, and finally the twist-in-the-tale. OMG! The venue switches to Udaipur.

After all, boys like Aakar Kaushik, Manish Nawani, Alok Kumak and Vijay Prateek, along with director Hemant Guha, are all out to let their hair down, be themselves and give life a chance. That is precisely the theme of this very-low-on-publicity and equally low-on-the-budget-front movie. But who cares. You don't need money, publicity or a big star cast. You just need an idea. With no business card, no sale proposition, no office, experience or recommendation, these four boys take up a catering business -- Shuttlecock catering -- not so much to make money (of course, these middle class guys have a moolah issue), but also to give things a try. Pass or fail comes later. And if this is what the filmmaker had in mind while making this docudrama, it's a thumbs up. At least you tried, buddy!  Back to the movie. Unlike other not-so-good low budget guy movies wherein suicide post failure, dirty underwears in their rooms and hunks running after scantily clad college girls ought to find place in the script, this one gets all its one-liner funny moments pretty bang on. Situational to the core. For instance, when they get their first contract, the boys realise they don't have a kitchen to cook. And when they get a kitchen, the boys realise no one knows how to cook, cut, clip and chop. What next? Watch it.  Don't go by the title. Don't go by the cast.

Surprisingly, Jism-2 hovers over sex, like a butterfly gliding across one of the many water pools the movie features. The few times the film does jump in, it lands in the shallow end. That's despite a hot start featuring amply-endowed Izna (Leone), all red lingerie, glistening high heels, tight suspenders and generous cleavage, riding intelligence bureau (IB) officer Ayaan (Singh) on a hotel room bed. The film's first make-out scene thus firmly embedded in its first three minutes, Izna wakes to a hangover and an offer.  movie  Ayaan and superior officer Guru Saldanah (Zakaria) will give her ten crores to take revenge on Kabir (Hooda), her former lover who went from honest cop to political assassin - while also going insane. \"Isi bahane tum mulk ki madad bhi kar logi,\" Ayaan tells Izna, who agrees. Why? Because Kabir left her one fine night - and vanished. Hence, pretending to be engaged to Ayaan, Izna moves next door to Kabir, hiding out as a musician in Galle, Sri Lanka. She walks about wearing tiny shorts, clingy tops and a wounded air, even chucking a rock at Kabir who still finds her jism and attitude irresistible. Seeking his secret data, Izna fakes leaving Ayaan to marry Kabir. But there's a problem - Ayaan's in love with Izna. And Kabir's got doubts.  Jism-2 offers several surprises, foremost being Leone's performance. As the dazzling, yet dazed Izna, Leone pulls off a tricky act that showcases both her eyes and bust in equal measure. At times, you forget Leone's physical assets, especially when she seals the film with a dynamite closing line. Sunny may be honey-trap - but despite spending most of the movie in plunging night-wear, she conveys delicacy and grace. Hooda's act is jerkier - at times, he gazes at Izna with tenderness you can touch. At others, his head-holding anguish makes you wince. The direction is shaky - in one sequence, Kabir's practically killing a cello with his song, hacking the instrument to the screechy Ishq bhi kiya - but then, according to the IB, he is going insane.  Still, Jism-2's second surprise is the quality of Hooda's voice, almost Naseer-like at times, warm, caressing, with perfect diction. This, despite the ridiculous lines the actors mouth, like \"Us jaanwar ko apne dil mein paala tha usne, she knows him best.\" Zakaria's saddled with the worst. Describing his work, he says, \"I'm like a mukhiya without the moustache\", looking uncomfortable throughout his badly-fitting role. As does Singh, who sulkily pouts his way through, telling Izna to read their fake love story in a novel - \"Especially pages 16 to 30 - aur padhne ke baad jala dena.\" Which, being busy, she doesn't, leaving interesting reading for Kabir to find.  Without such plot absurdities, Jism-2 could have been tighter. Slicker. And hotter. Instead, with unexplained turns (how does Izna go from good girl to porn star?) and over-acting, it's often limp, salvaged by its last 20 minutes of suspense when Izna learns new facts about the IB. Still, Jism-2 offers one more surprise, earning it a couple more points. It's pleasingly aesthetic, all its sensuousness clad in spa-like serenity, its lighting - golden gossamer, dusty hazes, cool, pale moonlight - actually its sexiest asset.  Thank heavens for foreplay.

This has pluses and minuses. At its heart, Aalaap is a tense drama, portraying young college students caught in a violent political face-off. But like a guitar left out in humid air, its strings sag - and snap - at times.  Set in Chhattisgarh, Aalaap opens with a college music show rocked by Rahul (Purohit), the state's best student, an annoyingly perfect young man to whom district magistrates turn when they want some 'good influence' spread about. Rahul joins the DM's right-hand man, Bachchi bhaiyya (Raaz in a short but crackling role) to win over the state's most rebellious rockers, Subhash, Brajesh and Prashant (Pitobash, Shamim and Rajput, the last eye-catching with attitude and a braid), and put on a show. Rahul's good-boy influence spreads onto the three idiots. But the foursome's suddenly thrown into a situation where before their eyes, an army truck full of friendly jawans gets blown up, a seemingly calm doctor Bharti (Sengupta) turns out to be a Red colluder and in a town of chaos, curfew descends.  The boys are traumatized by the violence - till they decide to play music across the divides. One day, they're invited to the core of the Naxal corps where Andhra ideologue Anna Reddy (Sharma, whose dramatic heft holds the role together) watches them rock and roll. Interestingly, many of the Naxals are heavily-kohled, just one step removed from Sholay's Kaalia. But in rather a sweet sequence, Gabbar learns to rock, albeit briefly because that's just when top-cop R P Singh (Singh) descends on the camp in a blaze of gunfire. Trapped between hostile Naxals and trigger-happy troops, will the boys survive?  Aalaap's frames are notably fresh, capturing the state's raw beauty, its gamchchas, guitars, upwardly-mobile coffee bars and dark woods well. The editing is khata-khat quick and cameos by Yadav and Manikpuri, Rahul's rickshaw-puller father and uncle, add a little Peepli-lite to the proceedings. But there are serious drawbacks too - both Purohit and Singh are weak links in the chain, often wooden enough to rival the sal trees of Dantewada. Some of the dialogues are heavy with cliches. Announcing they're gonna battle the Naxals, one guy says, \"Unhi ke sholon se unhi ko raakh bana denge hum.\" There is no serious analysis at all of the conflict and while Rahul has a 'sweet girl' Sukriti (Ruhi), her role is as negligible in the film as in his life. An item number features curvaceous Miss Sri Lanka Gamya Wijayadasa - but falls mysteriously flat.  On the upside, Aalaap makes an effort to depict people caught in troubled times. Sometimes - in a shot showing Yadav weeping without words, the blue walls of his humble home bathed in golden gloomy light, in an exchange between Bharti and Anna, in depicting a callous, clueless regime - it does that well. A lot of the time, it falters. But its sincerity helps as does its music. Debutante rock group Agnee's composed more than a passable score, particularly the number 'Paaparapa' which hums away in your mind well after you've left the hall. Good job, Agnee - welcome to Bollywood. For the others, there's still some way out of the woods.

He wants to take the backseat bet. But who takes whom for a ride? We 'dare' you to find out. Because a 'dare' is the only thing that gets a rise out of the man in the rear view. 'Driven' in top gear by a sexy chauffeur who likes her hand on the stick-shift and honking for the heck of it. Beep Beep!  Meet Tanya (Kainaz Motivala). An aaj ki naari - modern, independent, ambitious, with oodles of attitude and tons of make-up. Her ideal job is to do something unique (Wow, what an idea! Zzzzz!); She believes if men can be make-up artistes, then women can be chauffeurs too (SUVs only please). So she's part-adventurous, part-feminist without a plan ('women can do anything a man can do you see'). Thus, when she sees a post of a job of chauffeur (for a high-profile client) to drive his fancy wheels, she grabs the steering opportunity. She's interviewed by her future boss' Dadaji (Prem Chopra), who's floored by her guts, attitude and 'research' ('Did you know, women are involved in 37% lesser accidents compared to men?' Uh huh!); and Dadaji believes that driver-devi is the daredevil who can change the way his rich spoilt pota, Arjun (Vickrant Mahajan), looks at life - mostly anally! She jumps into a self-designed white uniform (Driver-devi probably forgot that she was driving a car, not an aircraft), with coloured kohl-lined eyes (they change everyday, matching her moods maybe?) and reports on duty in time. Go girl! Meanwhile, Arjun turns out to be an idiosyncratic and arrogant backseat boss (his colleagues call him 'Terminator' - honk honk!), almost a slave-driver, who behaves robotically at times. The only thing that 'turns him on' is winning a bet. So our diva-driver challenges him to play 'driver-driver' for a few days; and he takes it on. They exchange a few dialogues, turn on the ignition (by lowering the air-conditioning in the car, really!), listen to some drive-music that he detests; and somehow still fall in love, like co-pilots in a romance cockpit. Chho Chweet! Of course, overnight this machine turns into man (with humanly feelings and blood gushing through his veins instead of engine oil); while 'chauffeurina' turns into a gushing girlie girl.  Vickrant Mahajan's debut is as blah as Mumbai in peak traffic, inspite of all his designer suits, he lacks the persona to pull off a high-speed debut.  In the direction area, this concept could be wittily humorous, but it's punctured by uninspiring dialogues, zombie-like expressions and speedbreaker-scenes.  Kainaz Motivala is strictly average. Sweet in parts, but lacking the spunk to champion her women's lib cause.

Camera!... Uh, huh, Reaction!? ... If you're 'allergic' to movies on movies, you're bound to get one. If you can digest anything Bollywood ... Picture this. So, here's a film on making films. A picture-in-a-picture. (All those harbouring a secret 70mm dream; and all wannabe filmmakers may please note) - You may throw away those books on 'All You Need To Know About Filmmaking'. Walk in right here, but wait, review abhi baaki hai. Hoo haa! 'Action'!  Amar Joshi (Suniel Shetty) lives, breathes and sleeps cinema. His Bollywood dream takes him from Benaras to Britain for a course in filmmaking, and of course, he lands in the Mecca of movies - Mumbai. Hereon, the picture begins. With a script for a movie titled 'Cheekh'(yup, we screamed when we heard that too) - based on a true story of a journalist who gets raped - he wanders from producer to producer, from Kamal Amrohi studios to Film City, to clinch a movie deal. Joining him on this filmi safar is his friend and wannabe actor, Suraj (Rajpal Yadav), who believes his talent has been 'raped' by the industry, and that he's an extraordinary actor who's been made an 'extra'. So what if he can't get a single dialogue right in the Pawan Putra Hanuman telly show (the only episode on his filmography), and at every chance he literally molests the angrezi language.

A typical street kid. Dreaming of flying sky-high. But no supersonic jets or choppers in his dreams really. Like the famous seagull called Jonathon Livingston, who only wanted to fly higher and higher, what this poor, illiterate boy (living in small-town Roorkee) lives for, is a string, a brightly coloured, diamond shaped patang. And of course, some breeze to lift his spirits and help his kite soar. The only driving force in his measly existence (living under an open roof, with tin drums for walls, and odd-jobs for a paltry sum of Rs.20 a day) is his knack for flying kites. Even his chachu's (Naresh Kumar), at times, harsh and tyrannical pressures to work for a living don't suppress his blithe spirit. In fact, with a few cutely devilish traits, bubbling energy and sparkling eyes, Gattu is a sweet soul, always sunwashed with hope. He has only one problem - Kali! A mysterious black patang (believed to do patang ka jaadu-tona), who has for many years, defeated all other kites in town, and no one knows who is her master. Our Mr. Smarty Half-pants who thinks on his feet, realizes that the only way to beat Kali is to fly his kite from the highest point, which is the local school terrace. And he pulls all 'strings', literally, to take on the 'black diamond' in the blue skies. Even if it means sneaking into school, pretending to be 'Agent Gattu', disguised as a student, lying to chachu, creating a web of ingenious stories and antics (of wafadar jasoos, aatankvadis, and barood) that leaves everyone convinced, charmed and confused at the same time. Rightly, a mind of a child is truly magical; all they need is sand to make a castle. Or a hand-made kite to save the world.  Mohammad Samad's performance is heart-warming, with wonder in his eyes and playful innocence he grabs all your attention. His confined world suddenly opens doors, and as he gets lessons on gravity and goodness, science and sach ji jeet, his large eyes twinkle with amazement - like he's just spotted ET on Earth.  Naresh Kumar plays his part well, as the austere chachu harrowed by Gattu's guts, who eventually melts and embraces him.  Director Rajan Khosa has intelligently made a children's film (which has been applauded in the festival circuit) that truly crosses all age barriers. It subtly throws light on compelling issues like child illiteracy and child labour without shouting from terrace-tops or turning into a preachy docu-drama. In one moment the story is purely simple, and in the other it's profound enough to move you, if not theatrically shock you. It's greased with a kind of paradoxical reality, yet, it leaves you upbeat.  Gattu is a must-watch for children of all ages (read"},{"Name":"Cocktail","Release Time":"Apr 28 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Saif Ali Khan, Deepika Padukone, Diana Penty, Randeep Hooda","Director":"Homi Adajania","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours 25 minutes","Review":" Two's company; is three a crowd? Homi Adajania's romantic comedy Cocktail is a slice-of-life film mounted beautifully and imaginatively on a large canvas with the vibrant colours of London, Cape Town and New Delhi. The film addresses the proverb--two is company; is three a crowd--situation throughout. With some super-light, sweet moments that one has seen in the mid-90s American sitcom Friends; that revolved around a group of friends in Manhattan; Cocktail deals with the fun moments and then the emotional turmoil faced by three Indian friends settled in the UK, whose paths cross inadvertently.  movie  Saif (Gautam)-the flirt; Veronica (Deepika) the rich-bitch and Meera(Diana Penty)the simpleton find themselves under one roof singing daaru desi and dancing to tum hi ho bandhu in perfect sync and rhythm. To start of, the wild yet vulnerable Veronica and the shameless flirt Gautam are happy to be in a no-commitments relationship, providing laughs galore. Veronica's best friend Meera is also happy to be the flower wall around the house, making sure not to get in the way.  Written by Imtiaz Ali, the script in the pre-interval phase breezes through with some light-hearted camaraderie between the three lead actor; some comic moments (provided by Dimple Kapadia playing Saif's loud Punjabi mother); and has rocking tracks by Pritam that transport you straight into the night-club mode, singing and moving in your cinema-hall seats. However there's also a downside. For example, the music provides an adrenaline rush and the comic scenes make you smile; but there's a drastic drop in the tempo during some of the talkie portions, where the gaps in the conversation make you restless.  Also the friendship between the two girls—Veronica and Meera is captured realistically and runs deep; but the same cannot be said for the relationships the girls share with Gautam. While Veronica and Gautam's equation comes across as flaky; Gautam's love for Meera too could have translated into a deeper passion. The longing and the yearning doesn't come across like it did in a Jab We Met or a Love, Aaj Kal. In all fairness where Cocktail scores, is the fact that most of us living in urban metro India, will definitely be able to identify with the three principle characters and what the emotional upheaval that this bunch of friends go through. The bonding, the fun-filled moments do strike a very real chord.  The film takes a more serious turn in the second half when friendship makes way for love. Yes, Cupid strikes at the intermission point; and the film follows the oft-seen path of a typical triangular drama that has been a Bollywood staple through the last two decades.  Cocktail does have some terrific highs. One is Deepika Padukone's performance. Easily the best in her five-year-long career; Deepika also looks sensational throughout. You almost wish the camera had stayed her longer on her in that red itsy-bitsy bikini. DP will definitely win notices and nominations for her near-faultless performance of the rich-spoilt-neglected-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold.  Saif is terrific in parts, insipid in others. And the other DP, Diana Penty makes for a pretty picture; but she could certainly do with some polishing.  Randeep Hooda as a rake, running a hoax marriage business, is completely wasted.  Pritam's music is charged and chartbusting. While tum hi ho bandhu and daaru desi are right on top; yaariyan and jugni are stirring and soulful.  The dialogue is funny; even outrageous with lines like-- 'I'm carrying his bun in my oven' and 'you're lonely-I'm characterless.'  However what Cocktail should be truly applauded for is its permissiveness. As a film it breaks, shackles and ushers in a new free spirit that Gen-Now will relate to.

Bol Bachchan (BB) reminds you often of one of those. Rohit Shetty's latest movie has a constant up-and-down aspect to it, one sequence making you shriek in your seat with laughter, another sending your mind wandering off to the mundane. But at the very heart of things - Shetty's madly in love with the movies and BB is his homage to that all-time classic, Golmaal.  movie  In Shetty's version, Abbas Ali (Bachchan) is desperate for work after he and his sister Sania (Asin) lose their parental home. A family friend Shashtri (Asrani) brings them from Delhi-6 to the feudal village of Ranakpur where Prithvijit Raghuvanshi (Devgn) is the lord of all he surveys. Blessed with two obsessions - speaking nothing but the truth and hysteria-inducing English - Prithvi is super-impressed by Abbas, even swallowing his story of being called 'Abhishek Bachchan' when events lead to Abbas breaking open a temple door. As Prithvi insists on employing 'Abhishek', Shastri's son Ravi (Krushna, positively sparkling as he reprises Deven Verma's role in all this golmaal) adds more wheels to Abbas's clattering spin, creating a Muslim twin brother and a super-pious mother to convince Prithvi of Abhishek's propah antecedents. With the mother played by small-time mujra star Zohra Bai (Archana Puran Singh in a loud, colourful role she carries off with the swagger of a satin sharara), and Abbas playing a highly effeminate kathak teacher, hired by Prithvi to teach his petulant sister Radhika (Desai) some dance, things only get funnier.  Devgn's at the top of his form here, mouthing lines like 'Hard work is the keyhole to saxophone' and 'Boy in armpit, hyper-noise pollution in city', meaning bagal mein chora, etc., with deadpan face and shining eyes. Bachchan sags at the start but sizzles with later hilarity, even pulling off a crazy dance sequence to Dola Re. You wish there'd been more of his mad antics but instead, the camera spends considerable time lingering lovingly on Devgn's cleavage as he drives a jeep, pulverizes liars and takes on his weasly cousin.  In contrast to the male leads, the two heroines look pretty but bring little more than a wardrobe of delectable kurtis to the film. In fact, the stellar supporting stars - Asrani, Krushna, Puran Singh and Neeraj Vora as Prithvi's suspicious sidekick Makhan - bring far more zest to the party. With its hilarious moments and film-buff touches - bits of Singham imagery, Bachchan channeling some of that Yuva aggression his way, references from Deewar to Dostana - BB's fun and games. But it's way too long and diverts you needlessly with that wicked cousin angle, a power plant that doesn't progress out of paper, an odd double-role for Asin, jokes overloading on the cheese at times and music that is surprisingly unmemorable.  On the plus side, BB's a dialogue-lover's delight - lines like 'fish and chips without water', Devgn conveying the situation of a 'jal bin machli' - sparkle across the plot and you can feel the love as the actors reprise bits and bobs of vintage Bollywood. On the downside, it exceeds by about 30 minutes and has that odd, uneven heart-chart quality accompanying the film. But that aside, BB showcases Shetty as the maharaja of madness, Devgn clearly his crown prince. And Abhishek? His judwa bhai, of course.

Malegaon lies 300 kilometres from Mumbai, its economy based on power looms worked by labourers upto 12 hours a day. These workers turn with delight to Hindi and Hollywood films, loving their fantasy and joy. Little wonder the town is flooded with things filmi, from cinema theatres bursting at their seams to DVDs sold on wooden carts, actors' hairstyles sculpted by barbers and starry kites dotting the skies, all thriving amongst henna-haired elders, mosques and stream, giggling children, muddy ditches, hazy looms and bleating goats.  But cinema in Malegaon isn't escaping reality. It becomes a way for locals to re-interpret reality itself, remaking hits from around the world. Hence, Nasir, who earlier made Malegaon ke Sholay, featuring dacoits on cycles, turns to Superman, grinning to the camera behind, \"Pehle Bollywood se takkar liya, ab Hollywood se lenge.\" Inspired by cinema from Chaplin to Schwarzenegger, Nasir bands together a likeable bunch - soft-faced Shafique with a Bachchan-obsession, shaadi video-maker and actor Akram, Farogh, a writer with drawling appeal. Together, they make SOM, the painfully thin Shafique reinterpreting a super-human with human weakness, wonkiness and wit.  As Nasir's crew tackle challenges - Shafique nearly drowning when Superman saves kids in a river, the camera falling in, scouting a pouting heroine as Malegaon's conservative Muslims won't let local women act, producing expensive 'chroma effect' by draping fluorescent cloth on a screen, even impaling Superman's buddy on a horizontal 'flying' pole, leaving the sidekick panting for a 'pain-cooler' - the camera follows with quiet intelligence, probing, not judgmental, empathetic, yet non-sentimental. Only a few quibbles - Malegaon's women are seen but hardly heard. Nasir's sibling drama is uncovered but unexplored. And how the money works could be clearer too.  Crucially though, SOM gets why Malegaon is crazy about cinema, even making its own - movies capture our madness, melancholy and magic, mirroring these to us, making us love what we see. It is in cinema that India's vibrant creativity - its tales and taboos, its violence and splendour, its lilting music and haunting poetry like Malegaon's amazing 'Chand se khitaab' - find free and faithful expression. Cinema in India makes us laugh at our weaknesses, applaud our strengths, watch with tenderness and heart our grim lives and eternal hope. That is what makes it precious. And it is this quality of understanding that makes Supermen of Malegaon a beautiful film. Go watch.

Yeah, sure! The city of dreams and disasters. Traffic and terrorism. Slums and skyscrapers. Bollywood and bhais. Corruption and 'cop'ulation. Cutting chai and 'cut-pieces'. The city of extremes. It's maxed out - Mumbai.  It's raging war against the underbelly of the city. Two daredevil encounter cops, Pratap Pandit (Sonu Sood) and Arun Inamdar (Naseeruddin Shah) are on a mission to shoot-at-sight. Ready to gun down anything (pointlessly) - but their power, ego and mean motives. Pandit, the young, fiercely ambitious and brutally brave cop (oh yes, he boasts of 150 medals, for a 'hit' rate that beats the count of tab tak chappan. No comparison with Nana please), is embroiled in a series of conspiracies, contract killings and suspicious criminal connections. Inamdar, a much senior and silently devious cop (with as many grey shades as grey hair), has a personal vendetta against Pandit, and has vowed to out-trigger his 'body-count' (even if it means throwing in some farzi encounters). The brief is simple, shoot-at-sight-as-you-like. The gritty drama sees a dash of glamour with a slightly-short-of-sizzle item number (Hazel Keech), and fleeting emotional moments between Pandit and his patni (Neha Dhupia), his pretty pillar of strength.  This no-holds-barred game of 'shoot-to-success', happens while a conniving neta, Tiwari (Vinay Pathak), plots his own political ambition; and a diligent reporter, Ashwin (Amit Sadh), who believes in nothing but sach befriends the sharp shooters (over beer and kheema pau), breaks sensational news as it's happening - from the cops' mouth. Eventually, Mumbai's 'clean-up' act turns into an unwarranted bloody affair, the dirty power-play turns into a death trap, and there's no way anyone can 'cop-out'. In his first lead role, Sonu Sood, gets his chance to play a Chulbul Pandey, (minus the comedy, though in true Dabangg style). With ample confidence and flair, he displays a gamut of moods and emotions that his chequered character demands.  Naseeruddin, as the vengeful, angry old cop, stranger to sympathy, doesn't belt out his usual knock-out performance. For an actor of his stature and skill, his role is partially sketched, and he's left with no choice but to bite the bullet.  The usually comical Vinay Pathak puts up believable act as a sly politician, with wise-cracks and disposable gyaan. Neha Dhupia plays the wifely act to the tee, and pleasantly breezes through the role.  Director Kabeer Kaushik, has a good force of actors here and a gripping premise (with strong references to prominent encounter cops from recent past), but he doesn't quite lead the way. There are scenes where he triggers good performances, but with the inclusion of too many facts, figures and case files, it loses entertainment value. And gradually the plot fades into dark gullies of our big, bad Maximum city.  You can take a 'shot' at this one if you want, but remember you're not at gun-point, really.

Sorry, make that a gang bang-bang; because that's how this story explodes - with bullets, blasts and bust-ups. Throw in gallons of blood, body-counts and 'boom-boom', true Bihari ishtyle. It doesn't need coal to fuel this revenge drama. It fires on Anurag Kashyap's penchant for the dark, dubious, deadly and daring. Starting in 1941, in the dusk of colonial India, in Wasseypur (Dhanbad), the land of coal and scrap trade, simmers an age-old hatred between Muslims and Muslims (Qureshis V/S Pathans). And the bloodbaths, power struggles, family feuds and gang wars rage over three generations.  movie  In this complex drama, with mobs of men (where you almost forgetkitne aadmi the) and myriad shades (mostly dark), the word to remember is Revenge. And revenge is best served hot, 'koyla' hot! Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), a good-willed-goonda, impersonates the dreaded Sultana daku (the real Gabbar of colonial India) and loots British trains. Growing gang rivalry compels him to flee his territory, and resettle as a mazdoor in Ramadhir Singh's (Tigmanshu Dhulia) coal mines, where he's betrayed and murdered. But revenge grows in the genes; son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai), swears (on his bald pate), that he won't grow his mane or rest until he has Ramadhir's blood on his hands. He's a hot-gun really, in bloody war and in bed. While he's married to the feisty and hot-tempered Nagma (Richa Chaddha), who bears him three sons (including Nawazuddin as Faizal), he sleeps around, philanders and marries the doosri aurat, Durga (Reemma Sen); a Bong firebrand, no less. History repeats, in (Francis Ford Copolla's)'Godfather'-style, as the sons-of-Sardar add their meaty parts to this bloody enterprise, of potent men with powerful 'pistols'.  Manoj Bajpai, in this fully loaded role, is spectacular. He gustily brings to life Sardar Khan, peaking his performance with devilry, crudity and cuss words, while ably toning it with comic moments and a human touch. Truly, a raw diamond in this coal mine.  In his acting debut, Tigmanshu Dhulia, with a striking command over his role, is 'bang' on. The real find in this mine-of-a-cast, boy gang film, is Richa Chaddha. She appears like a mini-handmade bomb, but is quite explosive. Reemma Sen, with few dialogues shows her curves and contempt with ease. Piyush Mishra, as the narrator of this long-winding saga (and Sardar Khan's chachha), magnanimously stays in the background, but silently offloads shocking shades of his character.  Nawazuddin Siddiqui, as a pothead son with a devious mind, even in a brief role leaves a solid impact. Director Anurag Kashyap, in his trademark style of story- telling - realistic, with strong characters, over-the-top sequences, and unadulterated local flavour (crude maa-behen gaalis galore), gruesome bloody violence and raw humour - interestingly spins this twisted tale. This first of a two-part film, is ambitious indeed; showing promise of brilliance in parts, but not bullet-proof to flaws. With a runtime this long, meandering side tracks and random sub-plots, countless characters, documentary-style narrative backed with black and white montages from actual history, it loses blood in the second half because of the Director's over-(self)indulgence. The dialogues are 'killer', adding more quirkiness to this chaos. The electric background score (GV Prakash) keeps the tempo in this drama, and the music (Sneha Khanwalkar) though folkish, is hip and cool. But beware; GOW is not for the weak-hearted. So, hold on to your guns, gamchas and 'womaniyas'.

And that's when a movie with an issue so strong -- that of corruption; that of a failing education system -- passes before you in a jiffy... even before you realise.

Vroom! It's time to go zoom! Rev up those engines and turn up that turbo firepower for a ride on '560 horses' (as the Ferrari's horsepower is cutely referred to in this squeaky clean, red metal enterprise). Made for all boys, who never really grow up, and all children who aspire to grow into the revered boots of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. And nothing is more aspirational than a sparkling red Ferrari - the exact same one owned by the Little Master himself. A vehicle that grows beyond its phallic symbolism, psychologists refer to, and stays the dream toy of all big boys. The better to bait them with, my dear.  movie  The bait here is a boy's big dream, of being another Sachin someday. Kayo (Ritvik Sahore) is a budding cricketer, with potential to play more than gully cricket. Rusy (Sharman Joshi), a single father, with a modest job (as head clerk at Worli RTO), straight-laced, painfully honest with Raja Harishchandra-like qualities, has one goal - to fulfil his little boy's dream. With a smile pinned on his face (brighter and shinier than a Ferrari at times) through all weather, he's ready to take on the world (of cops, thugs, wedding planners, and our very own Tendulkar). Kayo qualifies for a training camp at the Mecca of cricket, Lords, but there's a hitch on this pitch. Damn the talent, he needs to cough up big moolah for it. Mota Papa (Boman Irani), Rusy's haggard and hopeless father - who's lamenting a tragedy that's changed the game of his life - dissuades them from driving a pointless, fancier-than-a-Ferrari dream. In the meanwhile, a local wedding planner (Seema Pahawa) has over-promised a thug politician a sawaari on red-hot wheels, for his nincompoop son's baraat. And only Rusy can bail her out of this mess, with his cricket ka rishta, which steeps deep into his genes. Once the mean machine hits the road, all hell breaks loose, all rules are broken and thereon, begins a dream run that could even put Schumacher to shame.  This indeed, signals a new innings in Sharman Joshi's career. His performance is heart-warming, shuffling between light-hearted moments and tear-jerking emotions. Young Ritvik, like a true captain, holds the team together. This little stock of talent is so natural and expressive, he'll bowl you over.  Boman Irani, with his Parsi nuances, hunchback, slur, and a beautiful play of emotions ranging from despondency to exuberance, delivers a smashing performance. Paresh Rawal, in a small role, 'catches' you, right on. Satyadeep Misra (coach Vilayat) and Seema Pahawa score big with their superb supporting acts.  Sometimes, it doesn't take 11 players to make a dream team. Debutant director, Rajesh Mapuskar, has a winning team with just three, plus a red hottie (Ferrari of course, we're not talking about boombaat Balan). And guess what...we don't miss the presence of a pretty 'maiden' here too. The spirit of the film is in the effusive chemistry between Rusy and his son, which is entertaining and utterly moving. The writing (Mapuskar and Vidhu Vinod Chopra) is refreshing, Raju Hirani gives the dialogues his trademark spin, and the film unfolds with sheer subtlety and simplicity. Except that, the ride could've been shorter (jumping a few red signals would've helped), and a few speed bumps saved (a song with a flying red car). The climax goes on an emotional overdrive, and at times, with extra spoonfuls of sugar the film is too-good-to-be-true. But that's feel good cinema for you!  What tosses in its favour is the uniqueness of the concept (so what if you missed a ride with the real Sachin in his laal gaddi). Look at the brighter side of life, dikra.

Of course, it's 'election' (now how does the Orient pronounce that?) time and promises abound. The age-old joke, \"I will make a Paris/ Shanghai/ London/ New York out of this city if elected!\" is still swallowed by a gulping 'erectorate' (oops, electorate)! And that is the intense premise of Dibakar Banerjee's Shanghai. It's gut-wrenching, it's 'Made in India', unadulterated, 100% desi maal. Hardly sasta, but tikau. Nothing imported. The story pulsates in the heartland of India. Rising from the bed of desi politics, stained with the blood of hatred, guilt and treachery.  movie  Chaos unfolds in small-town Bharatnagar, rallying around an upcoming election, lofty promises and ambitious plans of making this township (where air-coolers and kachua chaap are a rare sight) a dream- city. A faction of Bharatnagaris are suspicious about the government's 'clean-up-act' with plans of a majestic IBP (International Business Park); with high-rise buildings, malls and other urban frills and fantasies. While the rest blindly support power thirsty netas, only serving their selfish ambitions, and proudly calling it 'pragati'. Wow! That's India rising, alright.  Prominent social activist, Dr. Ahmedi (Prosenjit) flies into the scene (by chartered flight), with bravado, balls and bhaashans - to save the citizens from exploitation and illegitimate political passions. Alas, he's mowed down by a speeding tempo. High-ranking IAS officer, T.A. Krishnan (Abhay Deol) is pressurized by his boss (Farooq Sheikh) to murder his morality, drop his investigation and give this supposed drunken 'hit and run' case a clean-chit. Whereas activist Shalini Sahay (Kalki) is treated like a foreigner amongst the brown-skinned and on a mission to prove this is not an accident, but attempted murder. While politics makes strange bedfellows, Jogi (Emraan Hashmi), makes porn-partners, as a part-time videographer of adult movies. But risque soon turns into risky business when he ends up with real video evidence that can expose this conspiracy. Hereon, the politics only gets murkier, ruthless and bloodier. And Bharatnagar turns into a bedroom of more morchas, murder and corrupted moralities.  Finally, Emraan Hashmi has let go. Also of hot scenes, hot babes and Himesh-isms. Dibakar can take a bow for that. With crude body language, a pot belly, stained teeth and mawali moves, he perfectly looks the part and pulls off an act he should be proud of.  Abhay Deol thoroughly impresses with his cold, restrained and authoritative performance. Add to that a subtle Tamil accent. He doesn't lose grip of his character for even a fleeting moment.  Kalki has few dialogues that probably prompt her panicked expressions throughout. With a character sketch that hints at an ambiguous past; she doesn't reveal much - in performance or otherwise. Prosenjit, in a brief role leaves an impact. Farooq Sheikh adds gravitas to this gritty drama. Pitobash Tripathi as a herd-following morchawaala, Bhagu, stands out.  Director Dibakar Banerjee's adaptation of Greek writer Vassilis Vassilikos's book 'Z' is impressively Indianized. The story-telling is embossed with naked realism, rawness and brutal honesty. Be it blood stained bodies, close-ups of blackened faces, or ugliness (of body and soul) - he bares it with gut, grit and gore. But it's not the first time we've seen the struggling aam aadmi made scapegoats by mantris who go back to plush seats in their power hubs. It's not the first time chapters on humanity and morality are shamelessly ripped from political text books. The story is predictable (expect for a few scenes), and the revelations that follow, don't send shockwaves or make your bellies churn.  Yet, reality stings. Sometimes more than the 'dengue and malaria' in our very own hinterland.  "},{"Name":"Rowdy Rathore","Release Time":"Feb 9 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Akshay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha, Nasser, Yashpal Sharma ","Director":"Prabhudheva","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 15 minutes","Review":" In case I get a spelling wrong, that's because my ears are still ringing with all the seetis and taalis at Rowdy Rathore. The film's an unabashed, gunpowder-hot, sambar-spiced star-vehicle which runs along energetically most of the time because its star - Akshay Kumar, essaying a double role as Rathore and Shiva - is worth it, something that's emphasized often. At one point, a girl asks Shiva, pursuing pretty Paaro (Sinha) from Patna, 'Na tum mein Hrithik ke looks hain, na Shah Rukh ka charm, na Aamir ki cuteness, na Salman ki body - what's so cool about you?' Akshay drawls back, \"Lagta hai Khiladi ko bhool gayi aap.\" Cue for crowd - erupt in rapture.  movie  Multiply that moment by 100 and you have Rowdy Rathore, a peppery pot-boiler brimming over with action, slapstick comedy and romance, dynamite lines and Akshay Kumar - lots of Akshay Kumar, channeling vintage heroes Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, adding a dollop of Jeetendra, topping with his trademark flair as he snarls, tongue deeply in-cheek, \"Don't angry me!\"  A lull in its second half aside, Rowdy's mostly quick-stepping, moving from Mumbai's malls to medieval Bihar where Baapji (Nasser) and his hamming henchmen terrorise Devgarh's townsfolk through pillage, beatings and rape. Till cop Vikram Rathore (Kumar) arrives on the Shramjeevi Express, assaulting local yokels with handy gannas, infusing new meaning to 'sugar-cane'. With terrific overhead shots capturing his exploits, the fearless Rathore even bumps off Baapji's vicious beta Munna, so Baapji won't rest till Vikram is killed.  Despite an injury to his brain (which the doctor says causes 'hammo-rage'), Vikram and his little daughter Chinki reach Mumbai. Here, their paths cross with Shiva who adopts Chinki when Vikram's felled. And goes to Devgarh where he tells Baapji, 'A village can have only one Rowdy.' It's time Baapji - or 'lemon-chus', as Rowdy addresses him - shoved off.  This involves toe-curling violence though. A guy gets stabbed in the mouth, a head's crushed on a rock, swords slash through navels. Against the gore, Shiva's dancing with Paaro provides breezy relief but the music itself is unmemorable. In a Prabhudheva picture, expectedly the dances are eye-catching, some moves like sweet caresses, some sexy little bites. Sonakshi glows as Paaro, a spunky Indian beauty showing flashes of her star-father's confidence when she snarls at the villains, 'O saand ke bhes mein kukur.\" This Patna girl's stepped out in style with Rowdy. But the same can't be said for those playing Devgarh's dread-struck. Apart from Yashpal Sharma (sincere as a junior cop), the rest are unconvincing, as is the villainous set-up itself, located somewhere oddly between feudal Bihar, accented Andhra and Sholay's bandit lair.  Indeed, Rowdy Rathore pays homage to iconic filmi characters - identical heroes, golden-hearted chors, brave Men in Brown beating evil people to pulp. However, it pays most homage to its own star, Akshay Kumar, who pulls off Shiva with style but Vikram less so, possibly because all that violence overwhelms acting itself. Not that the crowd seemed to mind. As Shiva exhorts a woman raped by Baapji's son to beat him up, the girl next to me cried, \"Why doesn't she?\" Her neighbour replied, \"She will.\" And she did - much to the crowd's Rowdy delight.

Jeeva","Director":"Anil Balani","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Ok, let's get this straight - Rakhtbeej is a film you laugh at, not with, the kinda movie you could see with pals, popcorn and a cushion to pop behind when someone's ear gets slashed or arms crushed. Gruesomeness aside, the film's full of howlers. Remember those movies where everyone said 'daynce' and 'chaynce', where the hero's lipstick was pinker than the heroine's and sexy scenes always announced with a silky blast of trumpets? This is one of those - most of the time.  Abhay Jatav (Maanas) is Beehad's top dacoit. But his gang's composed of baby-faced criminals, including dakoo 'Chabila' who's gay. How do we know? Guess.  Still, Chabila's the least of Abhay's problems. His second-in-command Sarita (Julia), who looks straight out of the nearest spa, not thorny bush, is in love with him (like he cares), he's in love with Poonam (Amanjot) who escapes her simple home to work as a professional but lands with the bang-bangs, and he's being used by politico Maya Singh (refreshing Anand) plus red-eyed policeman Reddy (Jeeva) whose thick accent sounds like he's telling his commissioner they need more \"oms, ommonition and bullet-proof chocolates\" to fight the dacoits. Considering the commissioner mulls, \"These bastards are a terrible menace\", they're clearly not rushing to action, despite Abhay massacring people merrily.  20 years later - Abhay's son Ajay (Maanas again - hail the double-role) is CEO of Dabral Companies which wins, ahem, licenses for telecom spectrum. Industrialist Dabral (slick Khattar) comes with clingy daughter Sanjana (Mansi) chasing Ajay, who falls instead for sexy model Priya (eye-catching Sayantini), posing for - don't miss - 'La Heaven hair remover'. That certainly comes in handy as the two plunge into pools and tiny beds. Everyone's having fun - except Ajay's rival Dharam (Gagnani), who traps him in a murder.  The idea of Rakhtbeej is to show how blood connects two men over two generations. Fine - except it's done very badly. Despite striking black-and-white sequences, the time-travel's ham-handed, the acting largely insipid, the music uneven, and sensing little real passion, the script's full of cusswords smoking like spent bullets. What stands out - no, not Rakhi Sawant's average item number - are the scenes of rural India, muddy, bloody and forceful. Maanas is almost convincing as the hulky Jatav but heavily wooden as Ajay. Indeed, Rakhtbeej's entire city portion drags what could've been a tighter film down into confusion plus gore - and howlers galore.

The fourth one in the rank. Though he's not a patch on his predecessors (the infamous '3 Idiots'). Avinash (Raj Tandon), quite a top ranker in school, harbours the common IITian dream for whatever lame reason. With low grades and an even lower morale, he goes to meet his Dadu (Raghubir Yadav) after a decade, for some consolation and comfort. Unlike Dadu who pampers him, dotes on him and even tucks his laadla in bed, Avinash's parents (Yashpal Sharma and Manjusha Godse), are so shamelessly consumed by the corporate chase that they display little warmth for their only beta. In fact, their 'sky-high' expectations and insensitive taunts break his spirit, leading to a nervous breakdown. Still, they care-a-damn. Weirdos, huh? On the sunnier side, while all this is happening his heart finds pehla pehla pyaar in neighbouring girl Muskaan (Anya Anand). From there the film moves on to terrace-tops and paddy fields. Pretty, but not positively encouraging (for us). 'Aal izz not yet well' in the story, yet, we don't give up (how optimistic!). This time hope comes fluttering in the form of a kite. Avinash is challenged to participate in a traditional kite flying competition, an honour his Daadu had pompously won ages ago. Suddenly, his academic goals are a thing of the past; he flaps his wings and takes a flight. Who cares about being a forerunner anymore? He's on a life-changing mission to be a kite-runner. Not just that, this young noble-heart reunites Daadu with his estranged parents, and out-of-the-blue-skies the oblivious couple spares time for the bechara bachcha and buddha baap, for a tear-jerking family reunion (Uff!). Capture this true 'Baghbaan' moment in your memory, please. A few touching, melt-down moments follow, all thanks to Raghubir's acting skills.  Debutant Raj Tandon doesn't have the muscle or meat to essay this role of a disenchanted boy trapped in an aimless ambition. With expressions like caricatured 'emoticons', he's awkward in most parts. Debutante Anya Anand has a certain sweetness about her, but seems fairly unrehearsed for this role.  The strongest actor in this drama, Raghubir Yadav, plays the ageing Daadu with fatigued lines and old antics of an emotionally high-strung, hunchbacked grandpa.  For a movie that's supposed to be inspirational, director (Gitanjali Sinha) gives us blah lines, lackluster story-telling - which is emotional at times, with an exhaustingly slow pace - weakening the script further. We get the idea of a kite being a metaphor for life and all that philosophy, but this simple story is so grounded, it doesn't take off into the khula aasmaan at all. And all we can say is... Kai po che!

There's a lecture on farmer suicides and employment scope. There is also an uprising -- of the locals against corrupt politicos and policemen - where change and people's movement shall be the ultimate winner. But all is lost to the too-many-loopholes in the script.  The big fight turns into a clash of the egos between MLA Kay Kay (Mukesh Tiwari) and industrialist Anuj (Chaitanya Naidu). The idea of setting up a milk factory is lost to the tycoon's foreign-return girlfriend, Anna (Ana Kanandadze) who is either seen singing songs or getting her gender right. 'Main bolunga', is what she tells a cop. The common man, aka villagers, are just too busy dancing to the tunes of some raunchy item songs scattered here and there. As for the sitting MLA, he is seen sitting for most part of the movie. He creates chaos while he 'sits' with face pack on; while he 'sits' ogling at the item he wants to bed next.  Finally, it's the performances that leave you very disappointed. Even someone like Omkar Das Manikpuri (that's Natha of Peepli live fame) seems disinterested to the core. The first time he speaks is right in the beginning of the movie saying the village needs the milk plant. No explanation whatsoever. The second (and last time) he actually speaks is when Mr Tycoon sympathises with him.

But like other RGV flicks, this one also blasts itself out of the water, leaving you savouring jarring camerawork, flimsy acting and over-the-top violence. Inspector Mahadev Bhosle (Dutt) creates Mumbai's department to battle, ahem, mafia dons Mohammad Ghori and Sawatiya (Raaz). Bhosle inducts Shivnarayan (Daggubati) and with skulls crashing on walls, children flung out of windows and criminals impaled on rods, they take on the underworld. So far, so gross, but the film pulls along, powered largely by Daggubati whose smokin' machismo holds Department together - but not for long. That's despite Bachchan popping up as don-turned-politico Sarjerao Gaikwad, all silvery hair, dark glasses, manic laughter and a tinkling bell. Bachchan's clearly having fun - but few viewers are.  That's because Department, which should've been a taut, tense encounter between three strong men, is instead ripped to shreds by too many weak actors given puzzlingly large roles. There's a most non-don-like Raaz, living in a shed, sporting an enviably slender waist exposed by mysteriously thin dhotis. His sullen sidekicks DK (Singh) and Naseer (Shalini) make one of the most unattractive screen duos ever. They mouth lines banally, shoot bullets expressionlessly, blow smoke dully into each other's mouths, yet have more screen time than Bachchan even. Others - like Shiv's wife Bharti (Sukhani, pleasant) - have little to do except dodge those bullets and bodies.  The violence might even have clicked, considering the tale's twists - but crazy camerawork makes you forget all that. Varma's experimented, placing multiple cameras at different angles, treating you to close-ups of bottles pressed to mouths, lips sucking cigarettes, zooms up Dutt's hairline. The camera even flips upside down, puncturing the tension that should've vibrated between Bachchan and Dutt. One line - \"Chamatkaar ko namaskar\" - nails it. You stagger out sensing something wasted - Nathalia Kaur's item number's more hideous than hot, the prettiest thing around is a translucent tea-cup, the action is mind-numbing. Losing the plot and three strong stars, Department shoots itself in the foot.

Uplifts or artificial 'jobs'? Madonna was pregnant at 42. Charlie Chaplin fathered a child at 73. Even our pleasantly plump Annie Monterio (Shernaz Patel) gets a 'little' pregnant at forty-six. After years of prayers, and divine intervention (actually the missionary position) she is blessed with her 'labour of love', a second child; the first is an adopted teenager, Ruth, who wonders why her parents didn't use a condom in the first place. While Annie's antique life is all about Goa and being a true wine-drinking Goan, singing in the church choir and attending Sunday mass, her much younger and less holy husband, Savio (Ash Chandler), an executive with an underwear brand has a higher calling. He believes there's no shortage of kinky people in India, so he sets out to launch an edible lingerie brand called 'Eat Me' (in flavours like vindaloo, bibinca, tikka, etc). 'Panty'-ing already, eh? Hold on, there's more to Savio's enthusiasm. He joins an inspirational salsa group (whatever!) by 'Cleetus' (thankfully, not a sex-guru), where a 'brief' encounter with a subtly flirty amateur photographer, Natalie (Seema Rehmani) and her short-term boyfriend, gets him into a mess that disrupts the breezy calm of his mundane life. Enter, Bruno (Sohrab Ardeshir), the local Goan Don, who tries to be Savio's saviour, but only ends up complicating this feni-flavoured film. Shernaz Patel lights up the screen, like sunlight glazing the silvery beaches of Goa. She's 100% natural, without a care for creases or crow's feet, jawlines or jelly bellies.  Ash Chandler is the perfect 'Mac bugga', wading through his mid-life madness, surprise fertility, erotic business ideas and urges (sexual and otherwise), with confidence and casualness. He's a cool (God)father too, often impersonating the iconic Marlon Brando to humour his family over dinner.  In his first feature film, director Sandeep Mohan captures pretty Goa the way Goans would love it - the setting sun, white beaches, minus the Pamela-Anderson-inspired nymphets, drugs, rave, rock 'n' roll. It's simple, pure, and breaks cosmetic cliches - that's the beauty. But halfway through the film, the wrinkles steep deeper, in the script that is. Washed away with stretched sub-plots in the wrong positions (don't think dirty), the film turns flaccid and is no longer the sweet, 'upright' Goan slice of life it set out to be. And we're left craving for a spicy Sorpotel instead. Burp!

While on his first-time adventure, this 50-something-year-old virgin is desperate to 'lose it' to a blonde (they share notes on meditation and 'levitation' too), but ends up entangled in an utterly unbelievable mystery. He's made a pawn in a Scotland Yard conspiracy to trap terrorist Abu Siddiqui (Kher part 2), his look-alike.

He can't decide what's the most filmi way to meet his maut - Deewar, Shakti or Sholay style? Yes, it seems Amitabh Bachchan almost walked out of his KBC avatar, on to the sets of this one for a special appearance. But even that can't salvage Bhatti's chutti.  Anupam Kher, in this overly-animated and consistently hysterical performance, fails to force laughs or emotions. With Kher, we expect histrionics that makes us spring up on our feet, not sink into our seats.  Director Karan Razdan, probably had a noble message in mind, but he lost the plot on the runway itself. With poor production quality, tacky editing, mediocre supporting cast, and sketchy characters that are written with little attention or aspiration, the Misadventures of Bhatti, ends up being an ensemble of embarrassing desis caught in a chor-police story in phoren land.

And it's as (t)horny as it can get. Splattered with bandooks and badmaashi, goondas and gaalis - starts this ajab prem kahani. Firebrands Parma (Arjun Kapoor) and Zoya (Parineeti Chopra) are childhood hate-mates, born into politically warring families who've avowed to hate unto death. So, in the rustic and earthy brown landscape of small-town Almore - where pocket guns are a fashion accessory, and local yokels could kill for anything - diesel or dancing girl Chand (Gauhar Khan), the Queen of 'Kwality Baar' - a love story blossoms between loveable rowdy rascal Parma and feisty, free-spirited Zoya. They growl at each other with the same fierce passion with which they grope each other and get-it-on. Most riveting in this love-hate plot, is the (fore)playful chemistry between the two, with their volatile verbal wars, and sexed-up lovemaking; even between chases and gunshots. Rare indeed to find such a beautifully complementing debut pair onscreen.  movie  In an impressive debut, Arjun Kapoor believably plays Parma with dollops of arrogance, energy and unabashed guts; chomping with the same crudity with which he shoots, spits gaalis, pisses on posters, manhandles his girl and makes raw love. He uses his boy-man charm topped with that infectious 'batteesi' effectively, and keeps up the temperatures throughout.  Parineeti Chopra is fabulously effervescent. As the 'mango 'ishmile' flashing Zoya, she's adorable and admirable. She lacks the obvious, larger-than-life mega-screen presence, but wins you over with her 'item'bomb' simplicity.  Gauhar Khan 'reveals' a lot more, of her acting skills that is.  Director Habib Faisal takes you into the heart of this small-town story, creating a politically-divided Almore with elan - penning gripping characters (a rigid and arrogant Dadda, a suppressed, dukhiari Amma, two overbearing brothers), but fails to maintain the crescendo in the second half. After highlights like a sensitively shot lovemaking scene on a rusty train berth, a subtly picturized romantic song (Pareshan), and a shocking pre-interval scene, it starts falling apart like a house of cards; ultimately folding into a predictable climax.  The flatness of the second half is what takes away from the pace of a launch vehicle that could've been memorable.  'Ishaqzaade' starts with a bang-bang, but ends up firing blanks.  "},{"Name":"The Forest","Release Time":"Apr 28 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Jaaved Jaafri, Nandana Sen, Ankur Vikal, Salim Zaidi, Tarun Shukla","Director":"Ashvin Kumar","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"1 hour 20 minutes","Review":" With shots of sheep's heads, half-eaten babies and a gnawed-through guard, The Forest is not for the faint-hearted. But it is for those who like their cinema taut, tight and occasionally terrifying. Radha (Sen) and Pritam (Vikal) rent a forest bungalow to untangle their troubled marriage. If the socialite couple was counting on privacy, they can forget it as the forest's top-cop Abhishek (a refreshingly good Jaafri), Radha's ex-lover, clearly carries a torch for her. Drawling lines like \"Centuries of instinct right here - in your balls,\" at the city-slickers, Abhishek and son Arjun (Zaidi) attach themselves to the tense couple and some stagey scenes follow, Pritam staring at Radha who's staring at a wandering shaman, at herself in a beguiling towel, at Abhishek and mostly at Arjun. A conventional film might have you pondering caramel versus salt popcorn by now - but The Forest's relationships are shaken by the jungle all around, pushing down on its characters, breaking the love triangle open to a man-eating leopard that hunts, chases, devours the forest guard (Shukla) and enters the house.  Growing heavier with the rustle of leaves, the soft tread of something dangerous just behind you, blood reddening a stream, The Forest has gorgeous jungle imagery captured by wildlife filmmakers and BAFTA winner Rajesh and Naresh Bedi. Some sequences are stunning - clouds like clotted cream glide silkily over the moon, a leopard flashes by for a second in a beer bottle, man and beast face each other upon a tree. As the four battle their own selves - with Pritam on a futile shikaar, Radha and Abhishek have sizzling sex that Arjun walks in on - and the leopard, the tension builds. Directed by Ashvin Kumar - whose short film Little Terrorist was nominated for an Oscar in 2005 - The Forest features excellent sound design, silences resounding with unknown dangers, music silken but unobtrusive. The acting picks up and a final reconciliation's moving - even with that leopard scratching at a door just behind. Framing what happens when poaching turns beasts into man-eaters, The Forest is a warning that should be watched.

This one's a cat stuck in a time warp - with all its lives, love and many masters. The jarring screech in this story though, is still a fur-ball coughed up from the early 90s. 'Dangerous Ishhq' is about as dangerous as Animal Planet - watched through 3D glasses (help!) from the safety of a living room. Yes, it has fancy words like 'Past Life Regression' and 'Soulmate', but so do educational docudramas. It has mystery; of love spanning 500 years, several cultures, Mughals, Rajputs and a partitioned India. Sadly, the magic is as tame as your neighbour's pet billi. Meow again! The story is repeated.  Supermodel Sanjana Saxena (Karisma Kapoor), is a cool kitten, until her wealthy boyfriend, Rohan (Rajneesh Duggal) is kidnapped. But ACP Singh (Jimmy Sheirgill) isn't one to pussyfoot around. He sends his troops out while this modern day woman straps on her stilettos, slips into designer clothes, glows with flawless makeup, and sets out to find clues. How? Without a sane thought she jumps into a therapist's couch, goes through tormenting (for us) sessions of past life regression, and travels across three lifetimes, as Geeta, Salma and Paro (unfortunately not the Devdas-ian one). Stuck in limbo, trying to reunite with her soulmate; poor chap, is always captured or killed in every birth by her other co-traveling, obsessive lover. The restless, lovelorn karmic souls meet in this lifetime (hopefully the last), to rewrite their destiny.

Add a group of friends led by Navin (Kohli), who pops the question to Nandini (Panag) before crashing headlong into a truck and you have Fatso's main course - how to live after death. And what to do if your buddy, thinking you're in the great beyond, makes a move on your girl.  Fatso's a whimsical film with a rhythm somewhere between jazz and an old Bollywood song. Starting on an innovative note, it's brightened by Kohli's sparkly performance, Panag's dimpled smile and every shot of Mumbai that's made prize-winning cliche-level. Its most stunning sequences however occur in the grim sarkari office everyone apparently visits after they're dead - there is no heaven or hell, posits Fatso, just hundreds of peons, files, queues and babus, eternally occupied in 'mittings'. But Navin refuses to rest in peace till returned to earth - as fat friend Sudeep (Shorey). With Shorey literally getting a new lease of life, having visibly restrained himself as the much-mocked 'saand' of his group, you imagine Fatso's second half will rev up.  Alas. Here's where Fatso flops down heavily. Any sense of magic, of life rescued from death, love saved from vanishing, even the funny ironies of a slim guy stuck in a fat form, is totally missing. The 'friends group' is unconvincing. Kala's notable as a chatty clerk escorting souls about while Panag stands out in the silence of someone hit by grief. A cafe sequence, where Navin sees Nandini ordering spaghetti, then crying in the ladies' room, is moving. But otherwise, strangely flat acting and banal lines leave Fatso more heavy than cheerful.  The film seems overwhelmed by its own smart styling - little details like a dress drying on a clothesline, a girl rubbing hand-cream onto her palms, are clever. But there's too much style, not enough substance. No-one but pretty Tanuja (Bakshi), whose boyfriend Yash (Bhoopalam) hits on Nandini, seems to have a job. Life's a round of bar-hops with holidays when the living gets dull. The movie's peppiest number - 'Fatso! Na jaane kab last time sofe se khara hua' - is reserved for its feeble end, pushed wearily by Shorey listing everything he loves - mangoes to mosquitoes - before Panag mercifully plugs his outpourings with a kiss. Willing, yet weak, Fatso joined a good gym - but could have done with a much stricter trainer.

That is gun dealer Sonu Dilli's (Emraan Hashmi) theory - If everyone in the world owned a gun, there'd be no war, only peace. He's as easy with his guns as with his gaalis, and like a self-proclaimed KKC (kutti, kameeni cheez), 'humps' a woman, ridiculously to the rhythm of 'ek rasta, do rahi ...' (climaxing to aha aha!). ACP Pratap (Randeep Hooda) is the always bloodshot, almost 'Devdas'esque cop, wallowing in grief at the loss of his wife, killed in one such shootout. This cop of 'caliber', has a personal agenda, he tracks down Sonu Dilli (forever with his pants down), and takes him under his wing as an informer who can expose the illegal gun racket, led by the deadly Mangal Singh Tomar (Manish Choudhary). In the meanwhile, Sonu is shot in the heart (by Cupid), and his ladylove Jaanvi (Esha Gupta) is a doctorni who believes he runs a shop called 'Kareena Cut Piss' (read"},{"Name":"Tezz","Release Time":"Apr 28 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Anil Kapoor, Ajay Devgn, Boman Irani, Sameera Reddy, Zayed Khan, Kangna Ranaut, Mohanlal","Director":"Priyadarshan","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 15 minutes","Review":" Look carefully - Tezz shows you a London Bollywood hasn't explored before. Forget those chiffon saree-soirees, lush parks and cream teas - Tezz's London showcases illegal Indian migrants trapped between violent ghettoes and furious policemen, wet sewers, oily garages and bomb-strapped garbage bins. This is a gritty city, normally shown as every Indian's vacation paradise - but what happens to those who want to live there, even illegally?  Tezz follows engineer Akash Rana's (Devgn) life unraveling as he and his workmates Megha (Reddy) and Adil (Khan) get hunted by British immigration. Rana suffers the cruelest cut - his marriage to British citizen Nikita (Ranaut) is declared invalid, he's deported, she's jailed for unpaid loans. But it's not over - four years later, Rana returns seeking revenge and the London-Glasgow Express, 500 people on board, finds itself laced with a bomb that'll explode if the train drops under a certain speed.  Sounds familiar? Tezz draws from different vehicle-thrillers, reminding you of Keanu Reeves' Speed one moment, Vinod Khanna's Burning Train another. But it isn't just another machismo-fueled race - instead, Reddy is Tezz's surprise package, pulling off devilish stunts, looking stunning in the short life of a desperate Megha. As Counter-Terrorism Command Chief Arjun Khanna, Kapoor looks good too - and with one glance at a boy with bandaged eyes, he reminds you of the acting power-house he is.  In Tezz, he's pitted against Devgn (the latter can play 'smouldering' in his sleep apparently) and occasionally, Boman Irani as Sanjay Raina, Railway Traffic Controller. In one tense scene, Irani controls a track-switch, trembling almost like a music conductor commanding a symphony. There's a shout-down between Kapoor and him - over far too soon. In fact, you're left wishing Tezz had more dramatic face-offs between its fine actors but instead, the film diverts into several tracks too many.  Mohanlal is poorly used as policeman Nair escorting a criminal via train. As is Ranaut, pretty in her now-familiar 'impending doom' style, but with little to do. Khan looks fresh but has a shaky role - topped with a thrilling chase. Mallika Sherawat performs an item number in the 'Desi Club', asking, \"Do you wanna get hot? Do you wanna get wet?\" - but after all that promise, dances little and smiles even less. Tezz's London, overrun by Indians, is also populated by Brits speaking hilariously fluent Hindi and despite pumping background music, features few pleasing songs, snatches from just one qawwali, Tere Saaye Mein, standing out. Otherwise, it's gunshots and grim lines, some pacey - \"Ye koi naya kameena hai,\" quips Kapoor of Devgn - some not.  Despite slick action and stunning scenes - bullets ramming underwater into a sunlit stream, a violet flower-bush before a cop-car - Tezz loses speed often. Here's possibly why - director Priyadarshan's oeuvre is putting characters in desperate situations and watching them respond. It works beautifully in comedies - but Tezz needs relentless pushing, not frequent stops pondering over the unfairness of citizenship. You can't run fast carrying heavy baggage - that's why Tezz huffs and puffs a little too much.

The film instead blows the top right off the dirty deals, the, well, intercourse between different power spheres ruling India's capital - business, politics, journalism, police, all meet in this slick flick. Depending on who you are, the intersections provide some pleasure - and lots of pain.  Hate Story starts with reporter Kavya (Dam) joining photographer-friend Vicky (Dwivedi) in exposing cement tycoon Siddharth Dhanrajgir (Devaiya) bribing a judge. Enraged, 'Sid' takes revenge - sweetly. Ignoring Vicky completely, he offers Kavya the sky if she works for him, letting him, as he terms it, use her talent. Remarkably, Kavya instantly agrees. Hugging a huffy Vicky goodbye, she leaps into Sid's deals, winning him a biggie in Mumbai. As a result, the tycoon takes her to dinner - and to bed.  But it's not quite as charmless as that - Sid makes love to Kayva in gentle rain, in fluffy duvets, in the shower, pouring her with expensive watches and a big diamond. Swept off her feet, Kavya's in love - till Sid drops the honey-brush, slaps her one and throws her out of work with chilling contempt. She's also expecting - but he'll have none of it. A forced abortion follows after which her unconvincing 'middle-class family' (spot Pitaji by his red muffler) abandons her. Seeking revenge, Kavya approaches Delhi's most plush and padded prostitute, demanding seduction classes. These last one hot little moment - but more sex with more men follows, all leading towards entrapping Sid within a web of truth and lies, exposing and exposes.  Interestingly, Hate Story isn't just one woman hating one man - it's also a tale of hateful deals, corruption, brutality and sleaze tiling the farmhouses fringing the capital, glistening in hotel bars, twinkling wickedly off the sunlight on the NCR's corporate buildings. It would all be so interesting - if only deeper and tighter. Instead, we get little sense of the porcelain-faced Kavya's torment, sliding from reporter to prostitute. We get even less sense of backup-BF Vicky's feelings - while we get way too much of Delhi's street-shots, wasted lines, lip-gloss thick as a moustache, bathrobes, jacuzzis and cars, all burdening Hate Story by about 30 minutes too many.  Underneath this, even the sex-scenes sag - the frontbenchers clap most wildly not at Dam's bare back when she's riding Sid's brother Raj, but at a Haryanvi cop telling her when arrested for Raj's murder, \"Kuch kapde pehen lete toh theek hota.\" Better acting and more music under-wiring this plot would've helped - the only memorable melody is the velveteen lament 'Dil kaanch sa', layering Kavya's trauma after Sid's brutality.  But there are pluses too - Devaiya stands out as a stammering little egomaniac and the electricity between him and Dam crackles. There are memorable shots - Dam staring with agonised eyes at Sid's office while having car-sex with a stranger outside, a moment of acute tension when she meets Raj's wife in court. One more encounter follows - but let's leave something to the imagination. Appreciate, if you will, the thriller, not the diet-erotica - that's rather an anti-climax.

With the looks of Brad Pitt/Aishwarya? The stardom of SRK? The talent of Lady Gaga? Well, you need a super-sperm that's one in a million, and Vicky Donor (Ayushmann Khurrana) is full of the 'spunk' that your fertile imagination needs. He's the biological dad of 53 healthy children! Want more? He's unemployed, single, and his view of sex is, jitna mile, utna kum. But don't slam him as a sex-maniac just yet. So what if all he does is 'shag' for a living. At least he breeds joy, cheer and sperms all over the world.  movie  Vicky's over-the-top Punjabi mother (Dolly Ahluwalia) - 100 decibels above average noise levels - constantly nags her puttar about his worthlessness. On the other hand, he's pampered by granny Biji (Kamlesh Gill) - more progressive than all the Dilli-wali kitty party aunties. In the meanwhile, fertility expert, Dr. Chaddha (Annu Kapoor), is frantically looking for a sperm donor for his rich clientele. Vicky is his perfect find, with the Alexander of Sperms. But obviously, he can't disclose anything about his baby-boom(for the moolah, of course) to anyone. It's just too unmanly for a Punjab da sher. Even the love of his life, Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam) who he eventually weds, is kept in the dark. This plants the seed for other complications, which pop up as surprises later.  Ayushmann Khurrana is rock solid. In this tailor-made debut, he's natural and impressive. He doesn't come from a filmi gene pool, but he'll hold his own (pun intended) in Bollywood. Newbie Yami Gautam is the estrogen element in this sperm-dominated enterprise. She's a sheer delight to watch, emoting effortlessly.  What keeps this film together is the solid supporting cast. Annu Kapoor, in a convincing performance, is bankable as ever. He only speaks sperm language, referring to men as 'complicated sperm', 'confused sperm', et al, and giving advice on how to 'up' the count. Dolly Ahluwalia, plays the dominating mother and saas-serving bahu with melodrama and laughable lines. The unforgettable act is Kamlesh Gill, lighting up every scene with sasuma-like sarcasm, interspersed with witty one-liners and a drunken scene that cracks you up.  Director Shoojit Sircar is back with a bold, first-of-its-kind concept that's taboo. He makes this sperm of an idea swim all the way. He intelligently uses comedy to break mindsets, without embarrassing moments or awkward lines. The film entertains, without preaching sexual moralities or social service. Even the music blends beautifully with the story. The winner here is the script (Juhi Chaturvedi), penned with subtlety, oodles of non-slapstick humour, while sensitizing the cause at hand. However, the lingo gets too Punju at times and the last twenty minutes could do with some editing.  It takes a man to make a film like this, literally. Kudos to John Abraham for his brave maiden production.  Thankfully, this sperm hits bullseye.

If you don't, make other plans - unless you wouldn't mind a political satire, even a grubby one.  AHDU opens with the cheery premise that where dharnas, sit-in agitations, were once a great way to fight injustice - cut to obligatory Mahatma Gandhi shot - today, they're a totally different beast. Exploited by all political parties, the dharna's a headache for the aam aadmi and a stepping stone for the khaas. Thus, 'Avsarvadi Party' leader Gopinath (Gunaji) approaches, ahem, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, yoga-guru Baba Lakshman Dev (Pal, very good in a creepy sort of way) to start a dharna against the incumbent government, targeting corruption and inflation, and hopefully pulling the regime down. The Baba plus sleazy sidekick (Qureshi, clearly enjoying corny lines) name a price the opposition's happy to pay. \"Baba karenge dharna, humein kuch nahin karna!\" they chortle, throwing an 'item number' party.  Meanwhile, from rural India, sincere Satya (Manikpuri, maxing his Peepli Live 'Natha' avatar, all dust and dreadlocks, yet oddly flat here) approaches Lakshman Dev to raise awareness of pastoral poverty. An eye on the dharna, the canny Baba makes him his prime disciple, in a glittery little line, exclaiming - \"Satya marega! Pichli film mein nahin mara tha!\" All's ready for the big sit-in except the ground. The Ramlila Maidan where rehearsal for the traditional Ramlila's on, and proprietor Kaante Lal's reluctant to cancel - till visited by don Makkhi. But the Ramlila being cancelled means troupe lovebirds Rahul and Priya can't mix-and-match. Dismayed, they approach the dharna - as Satya does too.  AHDU is an interesting experiment. It has rather modest production values but some great lines. It retains the traditional love-story (to its detriment) but goes out on a limb satirizing the political. It's commenting on what's currently happening but in ways not everyone's going to like. It's a cheeky little film - but you may find the laughter a challenge.

Yes, it sounds like an unfulfilled wish of every working professional in the world. Except one. Meet Aditya Pradhan (Sachin Khedekar), an egoistic, career obsessed man who indulges his family with mundane materialistic pleasures, but doesn't have a moment to spare for them. With permanently furrowed brows, weary eyes, and a perfectly dyed hair-piece, Aditya lives every day like it was Monday. Until one day he wakes up to find it's Sunday. And it's the dreaded Sunday the next day, and the next. What makes it worse is that no one ready to believe the oddity of his freaky situation. Harrowed and beaten by time, he desperately tries to end Sunday-everyday phenomenon, but alas, no luck. Enter Benaamkumar (Anupam Kher) - for the lack of a creative name - who enlightens him about simpler joys of life, giving and living. The seed of the idea is impressive. Outlandish too. Is it novel? No way! The core of the story is faintly borrowed from the Bill Murray Hollywood comedy, Groundhog Day.  Sachin Khedekar, the leading man of Chhodo Kal Ki Baatein isn't your routine 6-pack hunk. He's a common man with a paunch common enough to flaunt without a care, but that's not the 'weighty' problem here. The plot goes into such a painfully repetitive loop that he's haplessly stuck in there. He shows flashes of brilliance occasionally, though it's not the best we've seen from this powerhouse performer.  Anupam Kher, seems to be the other blindspot in the film. Normally, the one actor you can blindly trust sleepwalks through his role, as the wise-old-man, who has more insight than someone with eyes-wide-open. Talk of andha creative.  The supporting cast of Chhodo Kal Ki Baatein comprises of an ensemble of Marathi actors, and their theatrics are obvious; some over-the-top. All the characters keep reappearing and disappearing like ghosts of Sunday past, with their over-dramatic, theatrical performances.  Director Pramod Joshi, an established Marathi filmmaker, has an inspired idea here, fresh for Bollywood too, but he tries to drive home the philosophy so desperately that he ends up in circles. This dramedy has a couple of songs, an item number (Rum Mein Gham) and fine actors, but all this fails to amplify the seed of thought.  After a point, we get the big idea, but the movie continues to preach. And we're waiting to break away from this 'timeless' Sunday-go-round.

The director of 'Housefull-2' is in love with the movies - especially 1970s Bollywood, all disco-balls, leering villains and hard-chested heroes. Khan mixes this with luscious English locales, PYTs in short shorts, cheeky jokes and star power - and lo. You have 'Housefull-2' - a castle full of mischief under a midnight-blue sky, lovers, fathers, imposters and 'Prince Charles'. For those seeking Albert Einstein, step aside. For those who'd like an apple-pie comedy, all slapstick - and some slap and tickle - Housefull-2's a breeze.  movie  Khan follows Manmohan Desai's funda - give the audience so much, so fast, they'll be too dazzled to carp. It works - most of the time. Housefull-2 opens in London with sibling rivalry between, ahem, the Kapoor brothers (Randhir and Rishi), elder Dabboo 'najayaz' but given part of his father's business, younger Chintu bitterly resentful. The resentment seeps across this house - Rishi's daughter, Heena (Asin) and Randhir's girl, Bobbie (Jacqueline) at each other's throats. Each brother wants to marry his daughter to tycoon JD's son, 'Jolly' - Riteish who loves full-figured model 'J'Lo' (Zarine) but is too terrified to tell Daddy - Mithun Chakrabarty, striding across his English castle in a starched dhoti, a tycoon who smiles frostily only at Man Friday, Patil (a frothy Lever).  But the Kapoors engage 'Aakhri Pasta' - Housefull-1's Indo-Italian, Chunky Pandey - still wearing skin-tight neon suits, delivering his 'I'm-a-joking!' line with creepy panache. Marriage-fixer Pasta brings an eligible match to Chintu, but playing a vinegary uncle with tang, Kapoor insults the father - with offensive 'African jokes' - landing him in hospital. His son (Talpade) swears revenge, begging buddy Jolly to romance Chintu's daughter, then break it off - but jittery Jolly drags in muscular Max (Abraham) to have him play 'Jolly', employing sleazy Sunny (Kumar) for the other brother to get the same.  The rival Jolly-boys enjoy purani dushmani - but that's forgotten with two hot girls, a crocodile and a desert island that, like a skit in British comedy 'Little Britain', has a luxury resort behind the beach. Yet, some starvation for the clueless girls ensures love and soon, there are four pairs - and four Jollys - hotting things up. With each Punjabi Papa - and one Batuk Patel (Irani, all dimples and nasal inflexion, father of Parul, Talpade's sweetheart - Shahzahn, with more bikinis than lines) - vying for Jolly, the 'dirty dozen' reaches JD's house. But they're walking on water here. JD's got a temper, a dark secret - and a gun.  Housefull-2 is a bag of laughs with eye-candy - Akshay in linens, Jacqueline in minis - and some crackling performances. Mithun commands with sheer presence while the climax belongs to rip-roaring Lever. Riteish plays 'helpless' with flair while a guest scene by '70s veteran Ranjeet - \"From rapist to therapist\" - provides a vibrant stroke of colour on this house-wall. Abraham manages the muscle-man while Malaika Arora Khan sizzles in 'Anarkali Disco Chali' - and an oomphy little scenario later. But the film belongs to Akshay Kumar who carries off a sharp suit and 'jhaari-mein-chalein' jokes with glossy aplomb. And to Sajid Khan who, despite a smorgasbord of stars, ensures one prevails - the mad storyline. The music (Sajid-Wajid) could have been punchier while some scenes sag. But with cracks like, \"Aasman se gire, Khajuraho mein atke,\" as Akshay parachutes down on his mum-in-law, you can't complain - unless you were looking for Einstein, of course.

Well, 'thay-ter' can be good - but transported to cinema, it can stretch a bit thin. And feature some awkward moments - of which Bumboo has a few. A word you'd normally hesitate to use in polite company, this mad comedy, inspired by French film L'Emmerdeur, pluckily features no big stars. Instead, character actor Sharat Saxena - muscular villain 'Ronnie' of Ghulam - is its most famous face. As sniper Mangal, Saxena mostly holds it together, the film showing a few bright flashes, but then slipping into low-brow comedy that's so self-consciously 'thay-ter'.  Yet, Bumboo has some notable frames. It opens with Mika's warm-as-whiskey voice singing lustily of how 'life ki ho gayi bumboo', comments on comedy turning into 'treasury', a cop-raid on a Mumbai chawl unearthing a 1200-crore-worth swindler Manu Gupta (Pandey at his most scatological), taken to court in Goa. Here, the plot starts running mad rings, underworld hit-man (Saxena) dispatched to silence Gupta, a depressive photographer (Dave), a tip-thirsty bellboy (Mishra), junior hoods et al joining in. Bumboo has the occasional line of pure hilarity - hotel waiter Gomes remarks loftily, \"Mein management ke munh nahin lagta,\" his timing with Saxena near-perfect, the latter's focus shaken when fellow hotel guest Suresh Sudhakar ('SuSu' to critics - yes, you heard right), the chubby Dave, tries to kill himself, babe-licious wife Pinky (Mandy) preferring lechy Dr. D'Souza (Kaul). Petrified the police might rain on his assignment, Mangal tries keeping 'Su' from suicide.  But stuff happens - including a sedative injection shot into the wrong person, goons in hot pursuit forgetting their stepney at home and a cop in a cupboard. Add a hot babe emerging from the sea like Ursula Andress, cleavage showcased as talent, and that's a merry mix. Except for the 'thay-ter' - that wide-eyed overacting with incessant PJs, gay no-jokes, even some vomiting. Peppy background music lifts the bar frequently while cracks on screwdrivers and biwi-chors help. But Bumboo gets shafted by its lapses into lavatory humour - and too much thay-ter for cinema.

Sometimes the dangling 'carat' is just a lure to trap you. In a bloodied mine of diamond devilry. Kunal (Kunal Khemu) is one such man who gets suckered in by the glitter. Landing a job with a leading diamond company in Cape Town, he gets seduced by the lust of money and power. His almost fairytale life with Arzoo (Amrita Puri), slowly turning into a nightmare, as he's dragged into a diamond trap. The one-time pizza delivery boy from Mumbai is exposed to the gory diamond mafia, traders of illegal weapons and cold-blooded criminals. The frontrunner in this crime chain being his own boss, Zaveri (Manish Chaudhuri). Finally, he's left with only two choices - sell his soul for success, or get ready for a bloodbath.  Kunal Khemu is convincing as a youngster with modest beginnings, who turns into a greed-obsessed man. In the second-half, as the tale twists, his character emerges stronger, with emotions of rage, desperation and revenge well played out.  Amrita Puri plays the domesticated wife who silently suffers her husband's wrongdoings. She's pleasant enough, but gets to interact more with the dining table than with husband. Tsk! Tsk!  Manish Choudhary, the big cigar-smoking boss ends every other line with 'Superb' (reminding of the villains of old, like Ranjeet) is impressive. Bhatt favourite, Sandip Sikcand, as the scheming 'blood-brother', is not.  Mia Uyeda could be 'Missing In Action' for all it's worth (excuse the coincidence), with skin to show and not much talent - is the honey-trap Kunal falls for.  This one has all the toppings of a 'Bhatt shocker' - drama, emotion, tragedy and some sex. Once again they push the bedroom threshold - a semi-erotic, steamy scene between two women - every man's turn-on fantasy. Debutant director, (Vishal S Mahadkar), tells the story well, though some scenes are very stretched, and tries too hard to provoke a reaction. A faster pace, more potent dialogues, not to add some more dum in Kunal's voice, and a better background score - would have had greater impact.  While this one is engaging, it's not the 'rock' you'd die for.

Zindagi Tere Naam (ZTN) brings back those memories - with a twist or two. Opening with the magnetic Mithun as a grey-haired 'aam aadmi' helping a confused Ranjeeta (grim in her 1980s flicks, still looking serious) at a nursing home, ZTN travels through a love-story's tortuous - and unwittingly funny - moments.  Cut to 1975; Siddhartha (Aseem) is a long-haired, soft-faced young feller cutting wood in Dalhousie. He makes and plays, ahem, violins with his father (Sharat Saxena, Ghulam's fearsome boxer-villain Ronnie). Siddhartha sees Anjali (Priyanka) emerge wet from a lake and obviously falls in love with her. When she mocks his offers to make dosti (always a code), he jumps into a river, impressing her with his love - yes. It's that kind of movie. As they cuddle, you can't help giggle at the tacky sweetness of it all.  When Anjali's posh parents (fresh-looking Dalip Tahil, impressively iron- jawed Supriya Karnik) object, things fall apart. Siddhartha nobly forsakes heartbroken Anjali but writes her 365 letters - intercepted by mummy - while she turns to rich Vishal (Ashish) who's got good looks, pink T-shirts and a tiny role. Almost engaged, Anjali discovers Siddhartha's built her dream house and is waiting for her to return.  It sounds trite - and much of it is - but ZTN has a few surprises too. Dia Mirza pulls off an item number while the leads do decently, Aseem resembling a protein-fed Prateik Babbar. With an annoying habit of flicking his locks back, he needs a few hairclips while Priyanka needs a designer who won't dress her in bar-girl chic. The time-travel's well-edited and Sajid-Wajid's music is pleasant. In sensitive moments, ZTN captures the pain of losing a parent, the sweet, unanswered misery love is. But it's stamped all over with that peculiar 1990s feel, featuring howlers like 'Pahariyan unke pyaar se bheegne lageen', violins played without moving fingers, woodcutting boy building an English manor. Prolonged twists include someone getting Alzheimer's, thereby requiring the love-story be told - repeatedly. At this point, the guy sitting next to me went, \"Uffff.\" That said it.

Instead, Samir Karnik's Chaar Din Ki Chandni (CDKC) sparkles with humour - and some dirty fun. It opens with Anupam Kher as a royalty-obsessed Rajput arranging his daughter's marriage. Blessed with a still-hot wife - Eighties-star Anita Raj - and a battalion of dysfunctional sons - alcoholic Chandrachur Singh, pervy Mukul Dev, violence-obsessed Sushant Singh and oddly-silent South star, Harish (Karisma's co- actor in Prem Qaidi before she trimmed those eyebrows and turned into a diva), Kher's most normal son, Veer (Kapoor) arrives from London for the wedding - with his Punjabi girlfriend, Chandni.  Cute-as-a-button Chandni (Randhawa, sassy but not boringly sexy) wins everyone's hearts - but Rajasthan Royal Kher's adamant on a Rajput bride for Veer. Thus, this love story lingers under a razai, Chandni pretending to be a journalist covering the wedding, Veer seeking a way out, his brothers falling over the cognac-eyed heroine. When her parents - Om Puri in a scintillating performance, Farida Jalal in standard shalwars - show up, they mesh with the madness. Puri pretends to be Punjab's best wedding decorator (he's done the finest shaadis - 'Zail Singh to Manmohan Singh's') while Kher suddenly decrees dear Chandni should marry a good Punjabi boy. Enter 'Pappi Sardar' - Kapoor proving his flair for comedy that's alternately quiet, then blaringly loud.  Like a shaadi ka band, CDKC's tone is mostly raucous - and good fun. Its script crosses swords with British writer PG Wodehouse's zany plots (castle full of imposters, suspicious uncles, a mosquito-bitten Johnny Lever) while paying hurried homage to masala-mixed Bollywood, leaving little time to worry about subtlety or depth. CDKC is a movie made by Bollywood-lovers for those who like their cinema pretention-free. With tongue-in-cheek Deewar-to-Dabangg references, sometimes its humour (gay jokes, visually-challenged Sardars) can be way overcooked. But mostly, with its feisty heroine (who does a mean kick in a lehenga), its hilarious hero, some sweet chemistry, jokes involving the colour 'rad' and agreeable actors sprinkled around, CDKC is a breezy watch - with no dark night.

One shines amidst the bright lights of glory, the other haunts the ravines of notoriety. But in director Tigmanshu Dhulia's biopic, Paan Singh Tomar, the two worlds collide. And the result is a rather exquisite blend of drama, humour and tragedy; altogether eminently enjoyable good cinema.  movie  Beginning 1958, Tomar was a seven-time national champion in steeplechase, a grueling athletic event where participants jump over seven water hazards and 28 hurdles while running a distance of 3,000 metres. Born in the dacoit-infested district of Morena, Tomar was an Army jawan too. He didn't run for pleasure; only for better food that athletes were entitled to. How a simple jawan becomes a feared outlaw is the kernel of the film's story.  Dhulia, who worked with Shekhar Kapur in the seminal Bandit Queen, enters the crevices of the badlands of Chambal river and makes you understand how bandits are born. But he also brings out the camaraderie of the jawans and the gentle humour of a unit are rather well brought out. The beauty of the movie is that it blends the personal with the larger social truths. Tomar may have been running in Tokyo but back home in his village, his family must suffer the same oppression and humiliation as others.  The movie shows how Tomar himself is part of the feudal mindset in his own way. He prides in the fact that his uncles are outlaws and he tells his coach not to abuse him. For him, that is unacceptable. The movie illustrates the linkages between land and dacoits - how every affront becomes part of a memory and how every murder becomes a link to another, a never-ending chain.  The movie works because Irffan makes Paan Singh Tomar come alive as an athlete, as a husband and as a dacoit. This is a flawless performance from a consummate actor. As his wife, Gill comes up with a rare restrained performance. There is humour as well a delicate intensity in the romantic scenes between the two. Dhulia gets great work from the remainder of the cast. The camerawork, especially of the ravines and the river, is excellent.  In a country obsessed with overpaid cricketers, a biopic on a former national champion athlete is reason enough to celebrate. But Dhulia's film is much more. It is one of superbly crafted film that underlines the linkage of life, sports and society.  It is perhaps a sign of Bollywood maturing that another biopic on a famous athlete is in the making"},{"Name":"Will You Marry Me?","Release Time":"Apr 28 2016","Critic rating":"1.5/5","Cast":"Rajeev Khandelwal, Shreyas Talpade, Muzamil Ibrahim, Mugdha Godse","Director":"Aditya Datt","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Little girls dream of marriage from the time they get their first doll sets. For little boys, those very dreams are nightmares. Generalization? Not really. But a hardwired trait that's genetically built into us. And since boys never really grow up, especially the leading men of Will You Marry Me? - the stereotypes are played out perfectly. So much so that they invest crores of rupees in a joint-venture, betting that the 'last bachelor standing' (sic) will win this jackpot. It's a different thing that during the course of the movie, this 'partnership' is forgotten and all the big boys do, is get flirty with bikini-clad babes on beaches and bet on everything from love, stocks to cricket.  Rajveer (Rajeev), Aarav (Shreyas) and Nikhil (Muzamil) are childhood friends who hopelessly try and showcase a Jai-Veeru kind of bro-mance. Nikhil is on the verge of losing his bachelorhood to his sweetheart Anjali (Tripti Parashar), and the rest of the film is all about the series of happenstances in the run-up to the wedding. Ho Hum!  Fifteen minutes into the movie, we're hoping that things will take a turn for the better; but the marriage 'arousal' only goes downwards. Sex sells, alright. But an overdose of crudely used double-meaning phrases, () sexual innuendo; and in-bad-taste, out-of-turn slapstick may not necessarily titillate audiences. Even, using the 'F' word in apparent 'fashionable-cool'; or Rajveer calling out 'Hi Sex!' each time he meets his buddies - comes across as immature and corny.  Surprisingly, the normally dependable Rajeev Khandelwal is the one who disappoints the most. Mainly because one expects more from an actor of his calibre. If he's desperately trying for an image makeover then this film was the wrong start. His fans won't be mighty impressed with Rajeev's 'casual romeo' avatar. Will the deep, intense Rajeev stand up and be counted please. Muzamil is strictly the much needed male eye-candy in this misadventure. Shreyas Talpade is the only one who comfortably displays something more than mere machismo here - performance. His comic timing is good. In the bathroom scene, you see a glimpse of the real Talpade. Pun unintended.  The female eye-candy, Mugdha Godse (the bride's best gal-pal) looks good but has forgotten that this is not Fashion but another movie she's simply ramp-walking on. She looks good but seems lost in this testosterone enterprise.  With a weak script to begin with, a story that loses the plot from the word 'Go' and an unmoving narrative, director Aditya V Datt seems to have failed in his 'marriage proposal' to the audience.  The attempts to elicit a few laughs by stereo-typifying the gay community is not in good taste. After a while, we begin to gag on the gags.  Accept this proposal at your own risk. This is one marriage that's a bad idea.  "},{"Name":"London Paris New York","Release Time":"Feb 9 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Ali Zafar, Aditi Rao Hydari","Director":"Anu Menon","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"1 hour 40 minutes","Review":" Does your love change with the character of the city you are in? Do your pheromones trigger a different response when you kiss the same girl in different parts of the world? That's the formula of this three-city, romantic tour called London Paris New York. Reminding us loosely of the Hollywood romance 'Before Sunrise' (starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphi),London Paris New York, is a story of a couple who spend three nights, in three beautiful cities. This sparks a light-hearted romance over crackling conversational chemistry and long walks through the picturesque metros. Intensifying with dramatic highs, and emotional meltdowns.  Nikhil Chopra (Ali Zafar) and Lalitha Krishnan (Aditi Rao Hydari) are free-spirited, urban adolescents who meet by chance in London. They're instantly drawn to each other. Like most urbane youth on their own, they chat, kiss and vow to meet again in six months. In Lalitha's home city of New York. However, they decide not to pursue a long distance relationship, yet, they can't get over this not-so-fatal attraction. Hence, this mismatched and geographically-crossed couple go their separate transit lounges around the world, to search out each other, only to love and lose each other over and over again. Blame it on the rivers - Thames, Seine and Hudson - for pouring waters over their attraction each time. With a new twist in each city.  Ali Zafar is just the charming, almost cocky boy this love story needs. He is lovable, natural and subtly brings that slight cheekiness, sprinkled with boyish humour and attitude. He effortlessly adds dimensions to his character that is expected of his age and time. The casualness, yet confident aplomb with which he approaches his role is impressive. His emotional outburst under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York proves he is capable of much more than serenading you with his strings, songs and smiles.  In her first full-fledged lead role, Aditi Rao Hydari is immensely likeable on-screen, and confidently displays maturity in some moments. At times, her attempt to draw the right expression borders on being forceful, but the awkwardness only adds to the charm of this girl-next-door and her transition from a girlie-girl into a girl woman. The duo make an affable on-screen pair.  The London-based Tam-Brahm, Anu Menon, takes the Director's chair for the first time with a rather simple subject, but manages to make it a non-cliche for some parts. The screenplay (also by Anu Menon) lacks a certain sense of fluency and at times seems disconnected. However, the characters and dialogues (Anu Menon & Ritu Bhatia) are real and unpretentious enough to lure the youth, whether it's the slight reference to sex positions or the bodily chemistry of a lip kiss.  When you have a pop-icon for a music composer, the tracks are bound to be spot-on. Ali Zafar's music gives the film its freshness and adds to the lyricism of the love story. London Paris New York is a sweet story that deals with very real emotions. It is urbane, cool and thankfully, not dated. The simplicity of the dialogues makes it enjoyable. It deals with the trials and tribulations of the youth, and the complexities of finding real love. It probably won't move you to tears, but one thing is for sure -- after traveling across the globe, this one won't leave you jet-lagged.

We all know that. We also know that they invariably meet up with decent guys who become their knight in shining armour. So it is no surprise when Mini (Genelia D'Souza), a rich, thrill-seeking girl, encourages Viren (Riteish Deshmukh), an autorickshaw driver, to kidnap her. We immediately know where the movie is headed for.  movie  For her, it is the beginning of all the rush she was looking for. And willy-nilly, Viren becomes her partner. Together they break into homes and get drunk. And she even makes ransom calls to her own father. The twist comes when she discovers that Viren is no autorickshaw driver.  Breezy romantic comedies generally thrive on witty dialogues and the chemistry of the lead pair. And Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya does have some crackling gags and one-liners. Director Mandeep Kumar uses the famed Haryanvi wit to good effect although the narrative stereotypically links big biceps with peapod brains. One hilarious moment in the film comes when Viren shouts at a foreigner, \"Simon go back,\" a reference to the famous anti-Simon agitation of 1927. The stupefied foreigner mutters, \"How did he know my name is Simon?\"  Post-marriage, TNLHG is Riteish and Genelia's first film together. And they look good as a pair. The movie could have been to Genelia what Jab We Met is to Kareena Kapoor. But she often goes over the top. At other times, she is too besotted by her own cuteness to become the girl she is meant to be. In contrast, Riteish looks much more in control.  TNLHG is one of those movies that you like for 10 minutes and then don't for the next 10. The cycle continues for long. But the climax is fairly engaging and the man who makes it happen is Om Puri. His rousing speech is what gives the movie its last burst of vitality.  The movie also has some of the most hummable tracks of 2012. Whenever the narrative falters, Sachin-Jigar's music comes to the rescue. Piya o re piya, Pee pa pee pa and Mai vaari jawan are three gems of 2012.

But the makers of ? appear to have hit upon a marvelously inventive idea of attracting attention. By just naming their film the way they have seems to have raised online curiosity and become possible fodder for tweets.  The movie takes its basic template from the 1999 guerilla Hollywood hit, The Blair Witch Project, and it is possible to suggest other influences too. But this is a very smart localized scare-flick that relies primarily on an idea to define its personality. Apart from the larger gimmick of showing everything as footage found from a camera, the film refrains from using standard horror-film props, rather relying on the helplessness of the protagonists to gain sympathy.  The makers avoid every form of cinematic excess. The spirits announce their presence very gently -- the screen melts for a moment as if a pebble has been thrown into water before becoming normal again. The spirits are evil but they seldom scream; often they are just a gentle whisper. There are no monsters and no manipulative background music. Yet sounds - a sudden loud bang or a dull thud - are used adroitly to scare.  Made on a bikini-budget, ? is efficient experimental cinema with clever use of the dialogues and sharp camerawork. That's a compliment to the behind men and women behind scenes. It wouldn't have worked but for the natural acting by the gang of seven, most of them rookies. They really look and behave like friends. Simraan (the character's name) is special in the scene where the spirits drive her into a frenzy. That's physical acting at its best.  It is sad that the film does not mention the name of the actors and technicians in its credits to emphasize on its 'fake' authenticity. Even the name of director is given as the guy who \"compiled the footage\". Nonetheless, go and drench yourself in fear. Couples watching the film might find themselves clinging to one another for reasons other than love.

She is dressed in a black sari and matching blouse; her pitch-dark hair caressing her body. And in that singular moment, Sachin (Prateik), a mechanical engineer who wants to make movies, is transformed into a butterfly of uncontrollable desire. He is smitten and finds himself walking on air.  But love never comes easy. Especially if the boy belongs to a family of Marathi Konkanastha Brahmans and the girl Jessie (Amy Jackson) is a Malayali Christian. There are other 'pangas' too. The girl is older than him and her father and brother abhor the boy. But Sachin is too besotted to notice.  Intense stories of first love are rare in Bollywood Lite nowadays. But Ekk Deewana Tha, originally made in Tamil, takes the route of extreme ardor. Love isn't a walk in the park here; it is the war of life itself, a battle that envelops those involved and almost consumes them. Love is like a buried treasure that lies only at the end of a hard journey - and one doesn't know till the very end whether it is really attainable at all.  The good thing about Ekk Deewana Tha is that it chooses deep conversations and not deadly fists to reach where it finally wants to. It doesn't offer any insights into the art of love; rather it merely lays bare the regular confusions - is it love or friendship? - of young hearts. Exquisitely lensed in lush Kerala by cinematographer M S Prabhu, the movie gets too self-indulgent in the end; the last 20 minutes could have been trimmed to 10. The love story of Sachin and Jessie never becomes your own though the lead pair is okay. Prateik's voice is evocative; Amy Jackson, a former Miss Liverpool, reeks of an understated sensuality, though strangely, her skin-tone keeps varying with every scene. But together they fail to synergize their performances. Ramesh Sippy's presence too doesn't add any sholay to the proceedings. May be the movie needed more spunk in Manu Rishi's dialogues, to elevate itself. Even A R Rahman's music wouldn't figure among his Top 20 films.  Ekk Deewana Tha has its moments but it doesn't really put you in the mood for love.

Wrong.  movie  With only the faintest trace of the Hollywood hit, What Happens in Vegas (2008), Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu shows what first-rate direction and a cute but brave script can do to the done-to-death story of opposites getting attracted to each other. EMAET has heart, charm and an enviable lightness of being. And it certainly helps that the lead players are in fine form. Like quality wine, Kareena seems to improve with every passing year though you find shades of Geet (Jab We Met) in her part. And Imran brings just that right amount of balance to the difficult part of an uptight, gawky individual who evolves with every passing day. The movie is essentially his journey from boy to man.

The dark lets the devil out of our hearts. Strange things happen and not always for the best. A long night of unending drama has been the subject of several Bollywood flicks - the absorbing Is Raat Ki Subah Nahi and the foul-mouthed Ek Chalis Ki Last Local, to name just two. Like them, Valentine's Night is also a-night-out-on-the-streets movie. But the similarity pretty much ends there - and the reason isn't just because the action takes place in Delhi, unlike the other two.  Written and co-directed by former Tehelka journalist Kumar Baadal, the movie is an exploration of five young, wannabe cools - all nursing a farm-fresh broken heart - in times of social networking. They all slap their partners with alacrity and abandon as a sort of return gift before heading for splitsville. Unwilling to wallow in sorrow, they connect online and decide to spend the night partying in a hired limousine. The boys booze and sing \"classics\" such as Life mein itna virus hai, daaru saala anti-virus hai.  But soon the movie becomes like its protagonists who look all dressed up and have nowhere really to go. There's plenty of chatter. And the only guys who find the conversation funny are the characters themselves who often burst into hysterical laughter. Midway, the movie changes tracks. New characters crop up along with fresh sub-plots. The gang of five is sucked into Jat politics, a prostitution racket and drugs. Finally, the movie devolves into a shoddy murder mystery.  But there's little that grabs attention. The dialogues are occasionally sharp. And at least two characters - the Bihari studying fashion design who keeps ripping off money from his father and gets guilt pangs and the girl from North-East who tries a 'sting' operation on a lascivious landlord - had interesting possibilities that go largely unfulfilled. As for Payal Rohatgi, if long legs could emote, this is an award-winning performance.  Released with an \"adult's only\" certificate, Valentine's Night ends up like one of those car drivers in the movie who don't know where to go and keep circling the streets of Delhi.

But there's no running away from each other. The journalist is a veteran of heart attacks; this is his third. And when he tells the ganglord, \"We have both suffered heart attacks. That makes us brothers,\" their diametrically different professions cease to be barriers. They begin to bond. The weeks they spent convalescing becomes a life-changing experience for Shaukat. He learns to value the joy of being alive, to care and share, to look at concerns from another person's point of view. Outside, the wives of the two patients too forge a connection. United in anxiety, they also realize that grief often has a gender angle. But do such stories have happy endings?  Inspired by a true story, Staying Alive is a subtle yet engrossing human drama. There are few major dramatic moments in the film. And it isn't easy holding the audience interest through a series of conversations inside an ICU. But director Mahadevan manages to do that. And it helps that the movie isn't bereft of dry humour.  Mahadevan, the actor, is far less impressive though. But the film gets strength from Shukla's terrific turn. It is a role with a variety of shades and Shukla gets each of them right. Even the wives, played by Navani Parihar and Sunita respectively, add to the movie's muscle.  One of the most poignant scenes in the film involves Shukla and Rakesh Pandey, the forgotten hero of 1970s Bollywood. The latter delivers a restrained monologue to his wife in coma for the past seven years with nonchalant dignity. When he leaves, Shaukat wonders aloud, \"What if I go into coma?\" It's a moment where the don realizes he is little more than a weathercock in the hands of fate. It is also a moment of compelling cinema.

Once again, a 'pregnant' Vidya, ironically displays more 'male ornaments' (excuse the watering down) than most heroes. She takes on her role with power and pride. Living out of a suitcase, amongst strangers, she takes on the soul of the city. Her performance leaves you in awe of an actress, who walks through her role as easily as a stroll down Chowranghee Lane. And even that is perfected as a pregnant waddle, add to it her disheveled look and eyes dark with anguish.  Rana (Parambrata Chattopadhyay) is the freshman cop who lets Vidya take the lead, while subtly and impressively leaving a mark of his own. Intelligence Officer A. Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) shows fine talent as a ruthless, unemotional agent.  However, if anyone matches Balan as a 'hero', it is the city of Kolkata itself. The rawness, beauty and grime of the city are stunningly captured by Setu (Cinematographer), from haath rickshaws, trams to Kalighat and Camac Street. With all its celebration and splash of red and white (symbolic for married Bengali women) spilling over the city.  Sujoy Ghosh's script and direction show no 'pregnant' pauses. It slams home a shock value that a thriller rightly demands. The story totally grips you and leaves you at a dramatic high.  The background score (Clinton Cerejo) is arresting; the music is used beautifully to amplify emotions and dramatize moments. Amitabh Bachchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re' is powerful.

The transfer is supposed to take place over a high Alpine pass that hasn't been disturbed since the time of Hannibal and the fact that it all gets messed up due to human error and modern technology only makes humans to turn out more puny than they seem. Natural laws are after all always supreme, never to be challenged. But ah! for human greed... Can you expect something like this from our desi Players, a supposedly Indian vision of the Italian Job?  movie  Charlie (Abhishek Bachchan) is the catalyst behind the mission to steal gold worth crores for himself and his role model Victor Dada (Vinod Khanna). Naturally then, Dada, the bad man in jail repenting for his earlier sins, helps Charlie form a team of the world's best players. Once the team is in place, the deadline is 10 odd minutes to steal the gold from a moving train. This leads to a series of events where traitors and loyals are revealed creating mayhem in the hurriedly patched up team. While Bilal (Sikander Kher) as the explosive expert and Rony (Bobby Deol) as the illusionist make a brief cameo, it is Johnny Lever as the auto expert and Sunny (Omi Vaidya) as the makeup expert who do manage to tickle the funny bone with their usual antics. On the other hand, Abhishek once again reprises the character of Dhoom he seems to have perfected while Bipasha goes glam as in Race. She doesn't mind bad company as long as it takes her to the pinnacle of material success. Sonam Kapoor (Naina) joins the team in the second half (though she is there in bits and piece in the first half). She wants to meet Neil since he is the one who killed her dad. That's where she puts her hacking knowledge and her body/looks to use since she is the only one Neil has not met before. But eventually, it is Neil Nitin Mukesh (Spider), the ultimate no-strings-attached man, wild gambler at heart with a twist in the soul and tango in the feet, who slam dances his way away as the ultimate crook. Music by Pritam is good while it lasts. Some editing sorely needed, visual imagery quite polished, and the look as usual is of new age Bollywood.

More importantly, the plot has been finely crafted, with every twist and turn falling into place like a complicated albeit neat little jigsaw. With a canvas that goes on a cross-country ride -- Thailand, Malaysia, Zurich, Berlin -- the film challenges you to hop aboard its high speed scuttle and attentively follow the exploits of its glamorous gangster. One who oscillates between two avatars -- Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible) and James Bond -- without losing out on his desi charisma.  movie  The high point of the film is Shah Rukh's delineation of the character of the Don. The actor interprets him as an arrogant, agile, wicked and wild dare-devil who has the most bizarre schemes up his sleeves. But that's not all. He also has the chutzpah to carry them through. Taking off from the climax of the first film, the gangster resurfaces in Thailand after a suitable time span, creates mayhem and then, in an unprecedented and inexplicable move, surrenders before his old enemies (cop Roma), only to be sent to a Malaysian prison. Get ready for a breath taking prison-break sequence, where our maverick escapes with another old foe, Vardhan (Boman Irani). The rest of the film is essentially the execution of a meticulous plan where the duo chooses to rob the Germans of their currency plates. Easier said than done, but with the devious Don, rest assured, no mission is an impossible mission. Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts. But of course, didn't we know the actor always loved playing wicked despite his romantic hero image. Remember Darr and Baazigar, two of his unforgettable films?  Action is the other alluring selling point of Farhan Akhtar's film. The chases, the fights, the demolition, destruction, break-ins, escapes have all been done with a finesse that rivals the best of Hollywood. Watch the car chase between Priyanka and Shah Rukh and you'll get the point. It's not only high voltage that drips with passion which makes it seem almost like foreplay. The other notable sequences include the heist, the escape and Shah Rukh's larger-than-life leap from a high-rise while his assassin wrings his hands in dismay.  The film does lack a bit on the emotional quotient and human relationships are hardly given a chance to grow. But just when you think it's all sound and fury, there's a sensuous tango between Roma and the Don as the cop opts to help the gangster she once loved and the gangster is determined to save his junglee billi (wild cat), any which way.

She is more grounded and doesn't believe in compromising on her principles. Naturally, she finds it hard to forgive and forget a dalliance of his.  So far so good. But problems begin when the rest of the film becomes one long string of sequences where Sunny tries to say sorry and Simran retaliates with what's in a sorry! The film literally enters into static zone, once the romance falls into dire straits. How long can you keep watching a heartbroken guy apologise again and again to an unrelenting lady?  Essentially a non-happening film with mediocre acting.

Vidhyadhar has been brought up in a middle class family in Benares while Mehak is a middle class girl from Kohlapur. While Mumbai's cosmo culture has seduced Mehak, Vidhyadhar still dreams of the ghats of Benares.  Naturally, he is aghast at his new house-mate's attitude, her dress sense, her penchant for loud parties, her choice of friends....But that is only an initial reaction. For, underneath her loudness, she's actually a vulnerable, endearing girl, brimming over with emotions. The duo manage to strike up a tender bond, despite their diverse personalities, over shared dinners, rooftop soirees, exchange of memories and some tender love and care.  It's a refreshing film which keeps you involved with its sensitive portrayal of two lonely souls trying to find succour in an alien city. Interestingly, the film takes a balanced view and doesn't end up passing judgements on the polarised cultures of big and small towns. Both have their positive and negative points, states director Saurabh Shukla. And rightly so. Both Vinay and Neha pitch in interesting performances while Naseer excels in a small cameo.  Watch it. You won't get bored.

The killer, like the rest of the film is all plastic and prosaic. Also, there's too little horror to keep the goosebumps coming. Too many songs and dances divert the plot and a sub-plot about an alternate romance is truly irksome.  "},{"Name":"Lanka","Release Time":"Apr 29 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Manoj Bajpayee, Arjan Bajwa, Tia Bajpai","Director":"Maqbool Khan","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" The film works essentially as a no-holds-barred indictment of the lawlessness that prevails in the small, neglected towns which have somehow fallen off the map of India in terms of infrastructure, law and order and development. Small time gangsters and hoodlums, with direct links to the power brokers and petty politicians hold the town to ransom and run it as their fiefdom, with the police department virtually being defunct. Truly, it's the law of the jungle that prevails in these proverbial Lankas.  Bijnor, in the backwaters of Uttar Pradesh, is one such town where Manoj Bajpayee rises as the mythological Ravana. The film mirrors the tension and chaos of the mofussil area faithfully and does manage to keep you engrossed with the sundry little battles that ensue between the cops, the goons, rival gangs, conflicting communities...a virtual volcano, threatening to explode any moment. Add to this the confrontation between Bajpayee and his faithful henchman, Bajwa and you have enough drama to hold your attention. Bajwa's rebellion against his mentor, as he swears to set the girl free, is measured and controlled while Manoj Bajpayee's fiefdom is fearsome. In fact, Bajpayee's performance as the local dada is multi-hued and refreshingly fails to fall into the trap of the purely negative character, despite the heinous nature of his crimes.  It is the length of the film and its somewhat laboured tenor which works against it. A bit of pruning and editing would have worked favourably for it.

Indeed, a yardstick that would be hard to measure up to. And yes, his second film doesn't really match the zing and the verve of the first one.  movie  Firstly, there is no humour, no earthy flavour (remember the vows on the bread pakora), no tingling chemistry between the lead pair -- everything which made the first film such a winner. More importantly, Anushka has a role only post-interval and the first half is devoted to his exploits with the other three girls. He dupes Parineeti and Aditi by pretending he's in love with them, Dipannita by selling her a fake Hussain painting. And then tries to con Anushka by selling her useless land at an exorbitant price.

Sadly, the effort gets bogged down by the hysterical undertones and the preachy nature of the film which ends up essentially as a documentary on Sikhism. The characters keep yelling at each other, the background score is over the top and the dialogues are essentially short treatises on the history of the Sikhs.  Fortunately, there are bits and pieces here and there which keep the drama flowing. The family's attempt to secure justice for the boys has an earnest ring to it. While one brother has been murdered, the other has been arrested and falsely accused for the murder of his own brother. It takes an attractive American lawyer to provide succour to the beleaguered family with her promise to secure the release of the wronged son. And does she deliver? How!  Meant as a ready reckoner on Sikhism, the film should have had a larger appeal. Unfortunately it will find its target audience, mostly in its own community.

Primarily because there is a deep-rooted sense of realism to it which make the events even more distasteful and heart rending. The fact that the Muslim family seems as normal as any other family and displays no signs of fanaticism in the beginning works in favour of it. The father and daughter relationship is beautiful with the duo displaying a rare closeness and the father almost ready to comply with her wishes and send her to Cambridge for further studies. The tender bond between the two compounds the irony even further.... How could a father who loved his daughter so much cold bloodedly contemplate her murder?  He could, due to a misguided interpretation of his religion whereby he falsely believes in an ancient code that men have possession and absolute rights over their land, gold and women and are authorised to wage war for their protection. Of course, most of the brutality is unleashed on the behest of the father's elder brother, a fanatic to the core. But in the end, everyone is to blame for the chilling end.  Well acted, well scripted, the film is a sensitive indictment of honour killings.

That was enough to transform Reshma into Silk, a storm that refused to be quelled by anything or anybody. Determined to take on the industry single-handedly and carve a niche for herself as a sex symbol in a hypocritical world, Silk was the steroid shot that sent the world in a tizzy. Journalists and holier-than-thou art film makers like Abraham (Emraan Hashmi), hysterical women's groups and the ubiquitous moral police branded her the scum of the earth. But her legion fans were ready to lay their lives for her and the industry heroes, like Suryakant (Naseeruddin Shah) couldn't keep their eyes and hands off her.

The state has banned the film on the presumption that it would cause trouble with Kerala, the neighbouring state since they feel the story is based on the Mullaperiyar dam for which Tamil Nadu holds lease rights for 999 years.  But seriously, the film is less about the dam and more about stuff you fail to comprehend. Like, a Raj remanent who shoots himself in his head, a marine engineer who commands a ship that catches fire out of the blue, a romance that is half-brewed and bogged down by regressive overtones about unfavourable stars, an ayurvedic doctor who thinks he is an infallible seer, a politician who serenades a pet cobra and torments his physically challenged wife with it, while duping the village folk, like most filmy politicians do.

The guy bonding between them had already been showcased in Garam Masala but this film carries the camaraderie even further. True, the film doesn't boast of anything that even comes close to an intelligent quotient, but the perfectly tuned tango, salsa, hip hop between the boyz gives it a spicy edge and keeps you in your seats, goofily munching your popcorns.  movie  John's Nick, a high profile MBA from the London School of Economics, is the ambitious types who dreams of the great suburban life, with a beautiful wife (Deepika Padukone), two kids, a dog and a substantial bank balance. His girlfriend too believes that life cannot be lived on a mere chicken roll. Akshay's Jerry is the more earthy kinds, happy to eke out a living as a mall attendant, as long as he is able to share his highs and lows with his best buddy and housemate, Nick. It's Jerry who forces a reluctant Nick to join Sanjay Dutt's Desi Boyz enterprise, when the ugly face of unemployment stares them in their face. Naturally, with their characteristic abs and biceps, it doesn't take them long to become the hottest beefcake in town and life seems to be a roller coaster ride.Until Nick's girl friend discovers them pole dancing and the social security officer sends Jerry's ward off to foster parents. Time for turning the page and getting back to good, right and ethical life.  Debutant director Rohit Dhawan tells his story in a light vein and never compromises on the fun quotient. He seemed to have learnt his craft from his father, David Dhawan, well, but never plays it over the top like him. Moreover, he keeps the drama dizzily moving on and peppers it with a feisty screenplay, with some funny one-liners thrown in here and there. The telepathic conversation between John and Akshay is specially humourous and only augments their chemistry. Pritam's music is full of verve and the title song, Desi Boyz, has already become a chartbuster. The girls, Deepika and Chitrangada maybe eye candy, but they are delicious, succulent and sizzling. If Deepika's act is eyeball-grabbing, then Chitrangada's Economic's professor who sheds her clothes for every right answer is the stuff that dreams are made of"},{"Name":"Shakal Pe Mat Ja","Release Time":"Apr 29 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Shubh Mukherjee, Saurabh Shukla, Raghuvir Yadav, Aamna Sharif, Zakir Hussain","Director":"Shubh","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":"2 hours 19 minutes","Review":" Brave effort by a group of youngsters to make a film which has been co-produced by Hrishitaa Bhatt (actor) and directed by Shubh, the hero of the film. There is a sincere effort by these newbies to script and create a comedy of errors centred round the issue of terrorism and the paranoia it has created all over. But seriously, can't say how apt it is to fool around with such a sensitive topic and create parodies out of terror czars like Osama. Here, you have Omama (Zakir Hussain) and his terror network, Al-Baqaeda, hellbent on creating mayhem in India and outdoing the antics of Osama. Of course, Omama and his jihadis are bumbling buffoons. Now how funny is that?  Moreover, the film is funny, only in bits and parts and mostly remains an amateur attempt at making a comedy. There is too much and too loud background music, intended to make you laugh, in case you miss the humour. You mostly do. And there are too many characters running around helter-skelter in a single venue, the Delhi Airport, to sustain the inordinate length of the film. The use of the burqa clad figures as decoys and the red bag as the bomb is too stereotypical, considering this could have been an innovative, out of the box, youthful vision.  In terms of performance too, the film has nothing to showcase, except the efforts of veterans like Saurabh Shukla, the affable ATS cop and Raghuvir Yadav, the Dilli cop, who keep the drama flowing. A bit more training and gravitas in their approach towards the craft, then maybe there could be a film to watch out from this young group of wannabe filmmakers.

It's a cheerful film that makes you smile with its subtle humour, its repartee-filled screenplay, its deftness at handling the umpteen relationships and its finely-nuanced performances.  Leading this pack of oddballs is Russell Peters who packs a punch as the offensive, scheming Punjabi groom who not only wants the suitable Punjabi girl as his bride but also her dad's business which might just be handed over to the hockey enthusiast nephew, Rajveer. Rajveer, on his part, is equally charming as the diehard hockey player who smiles his way through all the lows and never loses focus, not even when his dad throws him out of the house.  But more than the performances -- and the hockey matches -- it is the sundry relationships that form the core of the film. Rajveer's unflinching bond with his family, his tentative romance with law student Camille Bell, his highs and lows with coach Winters, his camaraderie with his team mates and his love-hate relationship with bro-in-law Russell Peters make for some compelling viewing.  A little more spice and edge to the delineation of the game itself would have made the film an action-packed adventure too. Nevertheless, Speedy Singhs, with a guest appearance by Akshay Kumar (as himself), is an entertaining watch.

Loads of atmospherics, mood, sentiment and stunning visuals of a sleepy rural backdrop, captured in arresting mode by cinematographer Binod Pradhan make you sit back determined for an artistic tryst with cinema. Sonam's shy femininity as the anguished Kashmir migrant, trapped in alien terrain and Shahid Kapoor's boyish buoyancy add a spark to the proceedings as does their old-fashioned style of romance.  movie  Yes, the allure of the first half of the film lies in the vintage love story which proceeds through unsaid words, unexpressed feelings, stolen glances and lots of melody (Pritam Singh). The affair which begins in 1992, before the demolition of the Babri mosque has an oriental charm to it and makes for some moments of great viewing. It's not only Shahid and Sonam, but the entire ensemble cast comprising the villagers that lend a spontaneity to the proceedings. The demolition of the mosque and the political turmoil that ensues puts a brake on the tender banter and causes the lovers to separate. Aayat leaves for Mumbai and Shahid joins the Air Force.  And it's here that director Pankaj Kapur seems to lose his grip, at least partially, on the story which crosses continents and slips on the natural charm and high emotional quotient that made the first half eminently watchable. The lovers meet again in Scotland, but a Mozart concert can never really compensate for the rustic splendour of misty greens, mustard fields and rain drenched terraces. Too many comings and goings, meetings and separations, missed calls and opportunities, spurred on by the cataclysmic political events of the nation, tire you with their repetition, even as the evolution of Sonam into a style diva robs her off her native innocence.

But the amateur style of the film robs it of most of its appeal. Primarily, the fault lies with the performances of the lead couple who miserably fail to portray the trauma of the jinxed lovers. It is the ensemble cast led by veterans like Deepti Naval, Alok Nath and Vijay Raaz who do manage to lend some gravitas to the film.  Also interesting is the twist in the story where instead of depending on the men in their lives, the women decide to take things in their own hand and raise their voices of protest after centuries of silence, subjugation and exploitation.  A good idea that falls flat due to poor execution, Rivaaz is routine stuff.

While Imran is a picture of restraint and low key dramatics as the younger brother who falls in love with his bhaisaheb's fiancee, Katrina essays the role of an over the top bohemian girl who loves to break rules and disregard convention. It's hard to think of them as a romantic couple -- the awkwardness is almost visible when Katrina asks a somewhat dazed Imran to promise to kiss her everyday. Yet, somehow, the duo manage to pull it off in what turns out to be a light and breezy comedy where the traditional Bollywood love story turns untraditional and offbeat. But only partially....  movie  It's an interesting debut by director Ali Abbas Zafar, yet ironically something seems to hold him back from creating a full blown comedy. The first half of the film, with the umpteen wedding preparations, gets too long drawn and the fun and games that Katrina tries to infuse in the proceedings seem a bit forced"},{"Name":"Bas Ek Tamanna","Release Time":"Apr 29 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Reema Lagoo, Gauri Karnik, SM Zaheer, Sameer Aftab, Rituparna Sengupta","Director":"Rahul Kapoor","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Once upon a time in Bollywood, they made Muslim socials which ended up as cult films. Remember Mere Mehboob, Chaudhvin ka Chand, Mere Huzoor and the rest. These were films which captured the tehzeeb and culture of the Muslim community with mellifluity and artistic detail.  Bas Ek Tamanna tries to recapture that era and create a similar idiom while focusing on the highs and lows of a struggling Muslim family. But unlike the earlier classics, this one is so full of melodrama, and takes so long to come to the point, it almost enervates you with its tedium. The only highpoint of the film, if any, are the performances by Reema Lagoo and SM Zaheer as the old, still-much-in-love couple who are content despite their poverty.The youngsters are totally overshadowed by the veterans.  But when did character artists sell a film, specially when they hardly have a story to support their talent.

Never, never go looking for the predictable in this maverick filmmaker's films and you'll rarely be disappointed. For, Anurag truly likes to push the frontiers of contemporary Indian cinema and genuinely believes in saying something new, something different, something meaningful. And yes, he always loves to shock and awe....  Kalki's quest for her missing father is a sad, quixotic, twisted tale of love and longing with a climax that rattles you. Also, it's a sordid and tragic tale of incest and sexual abuse that are such an intrinsic part of a society that still doesn't know how to treat its women.  More importantly, it is the cinematic idiom of the film which impresses you. Kalki's world -- the seedy apartment, the sleazy massage parlour, the passionless romance, the cramped immigration office -- is a closed, suffocating world with almost no ray of light. The only hope being the young girl's dogged determination to find her truant dad. Kashyap pays as much attention to frame and technique as to story and character development, which is what make his films an artistic and wholesome experience. A word about Kalki's performance"},{"Name":"Bol","Release Time":"Apr 29 2016","Critic rating":"4.0/5","Cast":"Humaima Malik, Manzar Sehbai, Atif Aslam, Iman Ali, Mahira Khan","Director":"Shoaib Mansoor","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Director Shoaib Mansoor is fast becoming the flagbearer of a new wave in Pakistani cinema. Having already hit international headlines with Khuda Kay Liye, his highly acclaimed diatribe on fundamentalism and racial profiling in a post 9/11 world, he now returns with Bol, another hard-hitting indictment of the status of women in orthodox societies.  The film is a tour de force, both in terms of the performances by the two main protagonists, daughter Humaima and father Manzar and in the narrative which spills over with umpteen twists and turns, geared to shock and shake you up, with their horrific tenor. If Humaima Malik is picture perfect as the rebellious daughter who dares to question her father and even take drastic measures to ensure that justice prevails amidst all the inequity, then Manzar Sehbai is magnificent as the tyrannical man who is desperate to hang on to family honour and moribund traditions. The highpoint of Sebai's characterisation is the fact that he never turns up as the quintessential bad guy, despite his shocking deeds. It goes to the director's credit that he doesn't create heroes and villains and blames old-fashioned social mind-sets and blinding orthodoxy for the malaise. And the fact that the problem of gender discrimination is highlighted through the story of a single close-knit family adds to the emotional quotient of the film.  Atif Aslam fans will however be somewhat disappointed with his screen debut since his role is mostly undefined and secondary to the plot. Of course, he does lend his mellifluous vocals to the film as the friendly neigbourhood pop star. Topical and thought-provoking, Bol is a film you must not miss.  "},{"Name":"Bodyguard","Release Time":"Apr 29 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Mahesh Manjrekar, Raj Babbar","Director":"Siddique","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 16 minutes","Review":" A Salman Khan film almost always defies all logic, simply because it follows its own norms at the box office, irrespective of the quality of the product. All that the film needs to have the crowds milling, cheering and growing nearly hysterical is the trademark Salman touch. This essentially means a high-on-testosterone Salman, a pelvic-pushing Salman, a devil-may-care Salman, a can-do-anything Salman, a human tornado Salman, a goofy-in-love Salman, and yes, above all, a shirtless Salman. Stir up this cocktail and rest assured, the box office will jingle, story be damned.  movie  Once again, Bodyguard opened to an uproarious crowd, but all the din could not drown the fact that this one's mostly a non-happening film with a first half that gets extremely repetitive and boring. The romance between Kareena and Salman transpires in a juvenile manner through endless phone conversations, as Kareena tries to masquerade as the mysterious girl from nowhere. And when the romantic track has almost bored you to death, you have an equally lame comedy track to frustrate you. The whole sub-plot about Tsunami Singh, the servant and his antics is dull and distracting.  The film sparks up only in the action sequences which showcase Salman as the essential action hero who can perform the most impossible stunts -- dodge bullets, leap across walls, crunch bones, sky dive -- with impeccable ease and finesse. The fights have been excellently choreographed, specially during the climax. The music by Pritam and Himmesh Reshammiya has the usual chartbusters which include Katrina Kaif's split second appearance in the much touted item number. Performance-wise, the film doesn't have much to boast about. While Salman is his usual self, minus the Dabangg chutzpah, Kareena has seen better days. After all serenading a mobile phone for most of the length of the film isn't a very challenging role, is it?  The film, a remake of a South Indian hit, may end up as another blockbuster, like most Salman films have been doing in the recent past. Yet, sadly, this one's mostly bluster.

Also, the film has been lying around in the cans for quite some time now, nevertheless, it doesn't have a dated quality. And that's because there isn't anything new about the plot which follows the regular RGV format as it traces the birth of a gangster from amongst the common man.  The novelty of the film lies in it's narrative style, the stark black and white canvas and the gritty, realistic performances by the ensemble cast. It's a hard-hitting, non-fussy narration of the events that transform a no-nonsense slum dweller into a fearless, dangerous killer and a scheming gangster with Isha Koppikar lending depth to the lead character, Shabri. She pitches in a restrained portrayal of the archetypal down and out woman who seems to have lost everything, but her never-say-die spirit. Despite the tumult in her life, emotions are always kept at bay and action speaks louder than words. An equally riveting performance comes from Zakir Hussain -- always a pleasure to watch -- as the diehard cop who plays his own little games to ensure some good prevails over the enveloping evil.  The action is fast-paced, the acting is immensely watchable and Shabri ends up as a stylish debut by director Lalit Marathe.

Chitkabrey too must have one. Only, it completely defies you as you try to keep pace with the proceedings on screen. Nothing really makes sense, neither the college campus sequences when a grotesque looking Ravi Kissen is ragged by a bunch of loonies and forced to flee to his mama, back home. Nor does the act of vengeance when the loonies are forced to do a Sach ka Saamna sequel, baring their misdeeds of the past before a judgemental ringmaster. Naturally most of the misdemeanours focus on some sexual misconduct but all that sucking of pens and ice lollies only adds to the crudity -- and stupidity -- of the film, rather than the drama.  Can't think of anything really to recommend.  "},{"Name":"Not a Love Story","Release Time":"May 3 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Mahie Gill, Deepak Dobriyal","Director":"Ram Gopal Varma","Genre":"Crime","Duration":"1 hour 40 minutes","Review":" Based on the headline-grabbing case of Kannada actor Maria Susairaj, her boyfriend Jerome Matthew and the murdered television executive Neeraj Grover, Not A Love Story is a startling film. Startling, because it captures the nasty, brutal side of seemingly normal and nice people who sometimes, see nothing amiss in the most heinous of crimes. The casualness with which Anusha and Robin try to cover the tracks of their crime, dispose off the body of the victim, make love even while he lies dead and bloodied in the next room fills you with chill and dread.  And that's where Ram Gopal Varma manages to score a point. Artistically, this may not be his best film. But in terms of capturing the dark recesses of the human psyche, Varma scripts a chilling experience. Not once are the perpetrators engulfed with a sense of guilt or remorse, nor do they even remotely fear retribution. All they want to do is carry on with the business of life as if nothing has happened.  Of course, the film ends abruptly and leaves you with a sense of incompleteness, but while it lasts, it holds your interest. Both Mahie Gill and Deepak Dobriyal imbue their roles with a touch of realism and remain recognisable, ordinary small towners. Varma's camera angles are zany like always and his background music creates a language of its own.  Gory, yes but Not A Love Story is an interesting study of the darker and more devious spots of friendly neighbourhood types.

The setting is completely authentic with the drama unfolding in a village that skirts the Capital. Naturally then, it draws the attention of sundry politicians, industrialists and land sharks who see a potential gold mine in it, the local farmers be damned.  Of course, the film does have some rough edges and tends to meander a bit. Too many fringe characters and sub-plots tend to divert attention from the main issue. Nevertheless, there is an earnestness of intent and loads of meaningful content which makes for interesting viewing. The high point of the film are its performances, where all the actors are in sync with their characters and bring an element of freshness on a screen which is mostly dominated by plastic acts.  A serious and sensible debut film by director Parvin Dabas, Sahi Dhande Galat Bande is offbeat and fresh.

But while 1920 boasted of some high artistic merit, Phhir majorly remains a cold cut with the twist in the tale coming too late.  Till then, the drama is mostly a string of clinical encounters between the harried doctor (Rajneesh) and the mysterious psychic lady who has limited visions about the missing wife and her whereabouts. The encounters lack all chemistry, just as the sporadic romance between Duggal and his wife lacks passion.  Phhir kya? Go, if you must.  "},{"Name":"Aarakshan","Release Time":"May 3 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Deepika Padukone, Manoj Bajpayee, Prateik Babbar","Director":"Prakash Jha","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 47 minutes","Review":" Filmmaker Prakash Jha is a breed apart. Beginning as a premier proponent of India's parallel cinema movement in the 1970s-1980s, he never chose to lose his moorings. Instead, he opted to increase the contours of his canvas by opting for a kind of cinema that combined art with mainstream, meaning with masala. Hence the importance of films like Gangajal, Apharan, Rajneeti, where you will manage to focus on some of India's burning issues, without getting bored to death.  movie  Aarakshan follows the same rules of the games, where the filmmaker attempts to take an incisive look at India's policy of reservation and its impact on the Indian education system. Atleast that's the issue he begins with and focuses on in the first half of the film. The tensions that the Supreme Court's verdict on the Mandal Commission's recommendations elicit find a resonance in the day to day functioning of Bhopal's premier private college as pro and anti-reservationists threaten to shatter the campus calm. Principal Bachchan tries hard to impose discipline within the stormy precincts but soon, the turmoil sears both his personal and professional life. His favourite student and ward, Saif Ali Khan, who has managed to fight the odds despite his underprivileged background, accuses him of being a casteist and turns his back on him, while upper caste student -- another favourite -- Prateik Babbar, accuses him of being a pro-reservationists and holds him responsible for messing with the career of meritorious students. But more dangerous are the moves of the managing committee which begins to see a potential enemy in him and replaces him with the corrupt, insincere, vice-principal, Manoj Bajpayee, who chooses to concentrate more on his umpteen coaching centres than on the affairs and the concerns of the college and its students.  So far, so good. As long as the film concentrates on the key concern, it is full of high drama, with powerful encounters between the prime players. The confrontations between Amitabh Bachchan and Saif Ali Khan are absolutely explosive and riveting stuff, with Saif pitching in one of his finest performances after Omkara. But poor guy! Little does he realise what happens to him in the second half. He is suddenly and arbitrarily removed from the screen as the movie completely loses track from the main issue and peters off into a completely different story. One that tries to follow the usual hero versus villain formula where a larger-than-life Bachchan battles a mean and machiavellian Manoj Bajpayee. The issue of Aarakshan is totally forgotten as the film becomes a diatribe against private coaching institutes, with Professor Bachchan providing an inspiring alternative by giving free tutorials in a tabela (cow shed). Needless to say, all his admirers soon join the tabela revolution, including Saif who is reduced to a mere by-stander in the entire show.  Sad. Because as a film on the issue of reservation, Aarakshan was rocking till the first half. But as an omnibus on the travails of India's education system, it flounders into no-man's land. Watch it for the intermittent high drama and the gritty performances, scattered as they are.

More importantly, it brims over with heart and soul, leaving no one untouched with its simple message of providing an equal opportunity -- specially the right to education -- to every child in the world. Yes, I Am Kalam finally articulates a near-perfect children's film, with an equal appeal for adults too.  movie  The film acquires special appeal because of the tone it follows. Despite talking about serious issues -- the rights of children -- there is an overwhelming lightness of being that suffuses the entire drama. Young Kalam is such a happy kid -- like all kids are -- he makes you smile each time he appears on screen. Watch him sell tea on camel back to the foreign inmates of the resort, carry on long tete-a-tetes with Lakshmi, the camel, squabble with Laptan (Pitobash), his co-worker at the dhaba or savour his handful of books in the dead of night and you are bound to brighten up. Not once does he lose hope, lose dignity, lose courage or even complain. Of course, he has the support of his friend Rannvijay and the avuncular care of Bhatti (Gulshan Grover), the dhaba owner, to see him through. Occasionally, he wins the attention of the visiting French tourist (Beatrice Ordeix) too who promises to take him to Delhi where he longs to meet Prez Kalam. But eventually, it is the never-say-die spirit of the young protagonist that towers above all else and creates a stirring picture of hope and valour.  The film also scores heavily due to its life-like performances. The two young boys are excellent -- completely boyish and child-like, ensuring that Harsh Mayar did not get the National Award in vain. Equally impressive is Gulshan Grover in his most understated performance till date. A film that may not storm the box office, I Am Kalam will definitely stir your sensibilities.

In the celluloid version, Pankaj Kapoor once again proves what a fine actor he is as he carries forth the relentless struggle of the aam Indian against India's endemic bribe culture and official apathy.  The retired school teacher wages a little war almost every day, be it getting his wife treated in a hospital, offering prayers for her salvation, undertaking a simple train journey or trying to prove he's alive before a bunch of corrupt employees in a government office. But the inspirational part of the story lies in the fact that Mussaddi never gives up hope, nor does he succumb to the pressures of the system. There, before India Gate -- where else -- he vows to wage a lone battle against corruption and get his due by honest means.  The good news is Mussaddi isn't alone anymore. The Anna brigade is firmly behind him.

Seems strange, because Gandhi remains a shadowy figure in the entire proceedings, now and then marching through fields and mouthing soliloquies on nationalism and non-violence before a motley bunch of silent followers. The only link that the film maker establishes between the two disparate leaders is through a couple of letters which Gandhi pens to Hitler, giving him gyan on ahimsa and tyag. Don't know whether the German leader received the letters or even read them!  Apart from this tenuous link between Gandhi and Hitler, there is another superficial track of a bunch of Indian soldiers who enter hostile terrain on the bidding of Subhash Chandra Bose. Led by Aman Verma, the misguided Indian patriots keep reminiscing about their fields and family in Punjab while dodging enemy bullets. Connection, please?  And finally, there is the character of Hitler....Now Raghubir Yadav is a fine actor who has entertained us with many memorable performances. But here, he makes a complete caricature of the protagonist who has been part and parcel of many landmark films.

Murder 2 lacks the mellifluity and the passionate chemistry between the lead players. Of course, there are a lot of intense physical encounters between Emraan Hashmi and Jacqueline Fernandes, but their relationship is essentially a lame duck, with Jacqueline begging for more (love) and Emraan insisting `Enough!' In fact, you even have the girlfriend groveling in the streets, pleading for his attention. This is so unlike the sizzle and hiss between Mallika Sherawat and Emraan in the first film.  movie  Actually, there's enough in the film to raise the hackles of diehard feminists, but obviously this potent cocktail of sex and violence was never meant for the feminists. So, we'll set aside this issue altogether and move on to another plane. Murder 2 works primarily due to its pace. The first half is racy and scuttles through as the grotesque killer closes on his sundry kills. The second half does have Emraan meandering aimlessly on a futile search for a victim and he does take too long to close in.  But any sluggishness in pace is made up by the performances. While Emraan is his usual edgy self, Prashant Narayanan is absolutely riveting. Jacqueline Fernandes replays her role as succulent eye candy and the rest of the ensemble cast are competent.  There may be nothing original about the story, yet Murder 2 has enough to give the masses a mast time.

Grow up all you comedy filmmakers who insist on treating your audience as retards!  movie  Is it director Abhinay Deo who tells a story peppered with the most unusual incidents in a down-to-earth, matter-of fact way which works wonders for the film? Mercifully, there is no desire on his part to shock and awe you or send you into hysterical bouts of laughter, simply because the events are so bizarre, they shock and awe you by their very nature and keep the laughs coming relentlessly. Certain sequences almost bring the house down"},{"Name":"The Green Chic","Release Time":"May 3 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Voice of Shiv Jasani, Parshwa Shah, Mohit Shah, Aryan Shah","Director":"Sudhir Mehta","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Will Bollywood take animation as serious business? Will voice-overs in Bollywood's animated movies create an impact? And will Bollywood take its tween audiences seriously?

The mom's killed, the dad's kidnapped and Chick's left sobbing... and sobbing... and sobbing. Time for Chick to move to Mumbai, get daddy back and be the next brave thing.

The gangsters build up their empire with a bunch of street urchins trained to pick pockets. And with the passage of time, the kids grow up as one extended family, albeit with their hidden rivalries and jealousies.  With ambitions soaring high, and the heights of Malabar Hills luring the upstarts, it doesn't take long before personal relationships are put on stake and the hunger for power becomes the only motive to pursue, specially for the maverick Prashant Narayan who seems to follow no moral code, no law.  The film takes too long to get on course and is cluttered with loose, untidy bits that need to be edited out.

First, the entire film unfolds inside a gaudily decorated train, with each compartment throwing up a different story, featuring an odd assortment of people. Kind of gets you travel weary.  Second, most of the stories have no substance to them, unless you'd like to see dadaji Om Puri flirting with a random lady while dadiji elicits pangs of jealousy.  Third, even the principal story featuring the NRI groom and the `downmarket' Punjabi bride is corny and crazy. The tactics of the duo to call off the marriage are so juvenile, they don't even make you laugh. And when the pangs of love strike, it gets even more sad.  And finally, the young couple do not get to share even one interesting sequence with the Dadaji, the wily master of the game.  So, what's the point?

Also, of great import are the performances, specially by the Sen sisters. While Raima has already proved herself as a consummate actor who has created a niche for herself in independent, offbeat cinema, it is Riya Sen who reveals a startling new side to herself. In a complete role reversal, she plays the simple village girl who is willing to accept anything that destiny hands out to her. With her scrubbed, de-glamorized looks and her soft, rustic speech, she creates an endearing picture.

Of course, intelligent cinema is still a rarity in our film industry. But there are a handful of films, now and then, which do not demand you leave your brains behind. Prawaal Raman's 404 is one of them.  The highpoint of the film lies in the fact that it explores paranormal activity without abandoning science and rationality. And that indeed is a rare achievement. Set against the backdrop of a medical college, the film takes up the usual issues of ragging and student suicides but gives it such a tangy twist, you end up literally KOed.  The fact that the film proceeds at a languid pace also works in its favour, adding a touch of realism to the drama. In fact, no where does the story lose its realistic feel, be it in terms of setting, narration or performances. In fact, the performances are so life-like, it seems you have hobnobbed with the characters somewhere or the other. Rajwir Aroraa's new boy act is compelling, as he grows from class hero to campus weirdo, after holding conversations with thin air before him. Imaad Shah as the enigmatic senior bully is in stellar form, creating a sinister presence, without any hysteria or hype. Quite a natural, this young actor. Satish Kaushik as the avuncular warden who is just a half-rationalist is warm and watchable. But it is Nishikant Kamath's portrayal of the resident psychologist which ends up as the surprise package of the film. Kamath, who gave us the memorable Mumbai Meri Jaan, makes a fine debut as an actor with 404.

It tries to investigate the basic incompatibility of the yin and the yang through a set of urban yuppies who try to build and unbuild relationships in the harsh metropolis. The gender bias and miscomprehensions have an interesting twist as the three young bachelors give up their carefree camaraderie to cope with the unending demands of their girlfriends.  movie  But so far, so good. The film has two major problems which make it somewhat tedious viewing. First, it stretches a paper-thin story to inordinate lengths and becomes a real test of patience. The plot doesn't seem to move ahead from the fight-and-make-up sequences between the three ill-matched couples. The fights become repetitive and you end up wishing they just give each other a break.... And you, a break too.  Secondly is the appalling gender skew. Okay, relationships go wrong, but is it right to blame all the misdeeds on the foul female species. Doesn't seem fair, really.  The film had promise and does have a few funny sequences. But by and large, it's a case of promises unfulfilled.

And that's because he seems to be as much a psychologist as a filmmaker. After writing Taare Zameen Par, he writes and directs Stanley Ka Dabba, another heartwarming film about children just being children, with all their cares and carefree abandon. And adults just being adults, with all their idiosyncrasies, quirks and secret anguish.  movie  The beauty of Stanley Ka Dabba lies in its sheer simplicity and authenticity. The film creates a slice of life from the pages of any and every school in big and small town India where kids just want to have fun and teachers want to be the proverbial killjoys. Of course, there are exceptions, like the popular Miss Rosie (Divya Dutta) who generously sprinkles her conversations with terms of endearments and encourages every glimpse of creativity in the kids. The biggest bugbear however is Sir Babubhai Verma (Amole Gupte) who is more interested in gobbling the kids' food rather than teaching Hindi. Stanley becomes his pet peeve because he never seems to have his dabba, yet ends up having a daily feast with his friends. Why? Because he is the most popular boy in class and his friends simply adore him. Needless to say, Stanley's missing dabba becomes a metaphor for his mysterious life....  The other highpoint are the sterling performances. Almost all the adults have created picture perfect portraits of the various types of teachers all of us have grown up with. But in the end, it is the kids who walk away with all the laurels, specially young Partho whose Stanley remains with you, long after curtain call.  Don't miss this rich and nuanced soul curry for both, the young and adult heart.

Is Haunted the answer to the chill hunters' prayers?  movie  Not completely. And that's because the story is dog-eared and done-to-death. Almost every horror film has the wailing ghost of a nubile young maiden who sends outs desperate SOSs to anyone who dares to enter her domain. And don't we know why she's wailing! Still, we won't reveal the secret, which in any case, is hardly a secret....  But if the film works -- and it works quite well -- is only because of the special effects of the film. Experiencing the horror in 3D is indeed a novel experience for the viewer, specially since it is smartly done. Each time the ghosts lunge out at you, stick out their tongue or flail their limbs, you jump back in your seat. And yes, there are a lot of ghosts, performing a lot of ghastly acrobatics. There's even a snake sticking out its venom at you and a hurtling brick, almost missing your nose....Great fun.  Other than that, there is the scenic beauty (Pravin Bhatt's cinematography), a hummable music score (Chirantan Bhatt) and the eye for detail (the film moves back and forth in time) which keeps the hours ticking. Performance-wise, the director has opted for a bunch of new actors to pitch in as the lead pair. Sadly, there's nothing extraordinary about them and they hardly leave an impact. It's the veterans, like Achint Kaur and Arif Zakaria who end up giving you the goosebumps. And they do it in adequate measure.  Want to scream? Watch Haunted.

There is the usual upturned nose on the part of Lara when she is forced to encounter the dust bowls of mofussil India, which include suffering her down-market companions burps and farts. And there is Vinay Pathak's familiar disdain for the lady's la-di-dah ways. Also, there are shades of the other cult road movie, Jab We Met, which cloud the originality of the script.  But hey, the film has so much soul especially in the climax, it makes up for any shortcomings in story and vision. Also, the narrative has a sweet simplicity which transports you into the onscreen journey and makes you a willing witness to the bond-building between 'bhaisaheb' and 'behenji'. If Lara Dutta and Vinay Pathak carry the film through with their spontaneity, it is the fringe characters too who add spunk to the road show. And in case you need some more masala, there's Yana Gupta reinventing Zeenat Aman's classic item number `Laila o Laila'. Needless to say, Zeenat had more dum....

It always works, unlike most of his other screen avatars. Till date, Dhoom remains one of his most memorable performances, where his savoir faire as the sassy policeman stood up commendably to the charisma of the bad guys, John Abraham and Hrithik Roshan. Dum Maaro Dum reiterates the fact that Abhishek seems to be a natural charmer when it comes to slipping into the shoes of a quintessential somewhat crooked-somewhat straight cop. His body language, his dialogue rendition, his lazy zeal and laidback attitude, adds a cutting edge to the character of ACP Vishnu Kamath, Goa's desi Bruce Willis (Diehard) who plays the game according to his own rules.  movie  And Abhishek isn't alone in crafting a host of riveting characters who lend a special cadence to the film. There is Prateik Babbar and Anaitha Nair's teen love story that goes awry, once Prateik gets embroiled in illegal activities. There is Bipasha Basu and Rana Daggubati's bindaas beach romance that lights up the screen intermittently. There is Mafioso Aditya Pancholi and his mean guy act which flashes fire and brimstone. And there is the cop camaraderie between Abhishek and his team that adds substance to the proceedings. All the characters are credible and immensely watchable.  Further more, there is the stylization of the film and its dramatic narration that makes it a compelling watch. The film slags in places and needs tightening, but the lull is followed by a tangy twist in the tale, which makes up for the occasional yawn. Shridhar Raghavan writes a thrilling cops and robbers tale which has some quirky banter scripted by Purva Naresh. Add to this Goa captured in glowing colours by cinematographer Amit Roy and a peppy music score by Pritam, and director Rohan Sippy gives you a film that keeps the popcorn crackling, till the very end. So much so, you don't actually mind the `potty' lyrics, as Deepika Padukone adds a dusky sheen to them with the Deepika shake. Of course, there's Vidya Balan too, with her winning smiles, in a brief cameo, proving once again that she's the most in-sync co-star for Abhishek Bachchan. Remember Paa?  This one's complete paisa vasool fare.

Their's is a young vision and a modern sensibility that tries to steer clear of formula and cliche. And even if it looks at formula, it dabbles with it differently, as was evident in Dabangg.  Teen Thay Bhai may have been produced by Rakeysh Mehra but it has been directed by first-timer Mrigdeep Singh Lamba who does show promise as a filmmaker to watch out for. Just that his first film ends up as a half-blown venture where there are too many theatrics and too many loosely edited scenes to allow the film to unfold as an uninterrupted laugh riot. Now that's sad, because in terms of characterizations, the film is riveting. Om Puri's loud, crabby, me-centric Punjabi businessman act is quite funny, specially when it comes to his attempts to get his overweight daughters married. Deepak Dobriyal as the quack dentist with the quirky hobby -- he loves to iron clothes -- is absolutely mercurial, even as his love story with village vixen, Ragini Khanna, ends up as the finest track in the film. Ragini herself makes an interesting shift from television to films with her breezy act as the boisterous Punjabi girl who loves to lie. And finally, there is Shreyas Talpade who pitches in as the third brother, a wannabe actor, inspired by Hollywood pulp. His rendition of the happy-go-lucky yokel is completely over the top and tends to get too melodramatic, here and there. But by and large, between them, the three brothers create a tantalizing trio that keeps rubbing each other off the wrong side.  The film however lacks consistency and some of the comic situations fail to evoke any humour. While the brothers try to co-exist peacefully in the ramschackled bungalow and almost end up killing each other, the drama holds your interest. But as it moves out into the wilderness, with blondes, dogs, drugs and cops, it loses track.  Watch out for the zany music track (Sukhwinder Singh and Ranjit Barot) with Mohit Chauhan and Daler Mehndi giving a lively rendition to Gulzar's funky lyrics, some arresting performances by the key players and Ashok Mehta's camerawork which creates magic with Kashmir. And yes, there's Yograj Singh making his debut in Hindi cinema as the angsty Punjabi dadaji. Yograj Singh, who? Sadda Yuvraj Singh's daddy! All this might help you tide over the intermittent yawns that threaten to cloud an otherwise smart comedy.

Thank You is heavily inspired by his earlier comic caper, No Entry, where Salman Khan had the onerous task of curing a motley group of errant husbands from their chronic infidelity. This time, it is Akshay Kumar who wields the baton -- or is it the flute -- to underscore the sanctity of the institution of marriage. Is this a case of playing safe for the director who has recently burned his hands at the box office or is it a drought of story ideas that seems to be Bollywood's biggest scourge?  movie  Repetition notwithstanding, Thank You ends up as timepass fare, although it isn't as rollicking as No Entry. The first half of the film seems to be an exercise in nothingness and has you fidgeting in your seat as you try to look for the rare laughs in a script that is supposed to be funny. The bit-on-the-side sequences of the three husbands are hardly hilarious nor does the fuming wives club set the screen ablaze with hysteria. It is only in the second half that the film acquires form and substance and has you grinning at certain goof-ups. Akshay Kumar's elaborate plans to set the three marriages straight provides scope for actors like Irrfan Khan and Suneil Shetty to kick up a bit of fun, although Bobby Deol has hardly any humour tailored into his role. By and large, he remains dour and angry as he begins to suspect his sweet wife Sonam of adultery. The girls, on their part, mostly remain cosmetic with Sonam looking terribly out of sync, Rimmi not being allowed to play her feisty self and Celina being forced to do the disappearing act for a large part of the film.  So what's funny about Thank You? It's the guys who reiterate the worn-out cliche that fidelity isn't an intrinsic part of male physiology. Add to this the high production values -- glitzy locales, jazzy styling -- and Pritam's pop numbers and you have a film that can be an average weekend getaway. Nothing more, not even Mallika Sherawat's item number.

The romance between Blu and Jewel does form the core of this high-spirited animation film. And that's because the characters acquire spunk and soul with the voice-overs of Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway. The constant sparring between the two oddballs gradually grows into a special bond as the chained-together birds seek survival in a city spilling over with bird kidnappers, evil cockatoos, wicked monkeys and a maddening carnival.  But apart from the love birds, there are a host of other characters who spice up the proceedings, like the super villainous Nigel, the friend and guide pelican, the drooling-bumbling bull dog and Blu's benevolent owner, Linda with her blossoming romance with the ornithologist.  Technically, the film is a feast with state-of-the-art animation. The jungles of South America and the sprawling city of Rio become a riot of colours, specially when the climax builds up during the carnival. The screenplay is witty and evokes many a chuckle, here and there. The star of the show however is Jesse Eisenberg who adds a whole lot of attitude to Blu, the urbane macaw, with his excellent voice-over.

The campus becomes a hub where budding chefs, physical trainers, actors, dancers, fashion designers, hair dressers, tattoo artists are supposed to hone their skills. But when the digital lectures by real life experts actually begin, you know its time to scoot. In case you still hang around, you might see director Remo D'Souza recreate his television dance show in the climax. Again totally unnecessary, 'coz you've seen it all before on your personal TV.  The problem with F.A.L.T.U lies in its tone. It doesn't know whether to unfold as a full blown comedy or take itself seriously by providing some gyan on the education system. Wish it had chosen to remain just funny. Jackky and his buddies hardly represent GenX, even as the elders, specially Akbar Khan, end up as caricatures. Both Arshad and Riteish are totally indifferent as the supporting cast. The only thing to recommend is the music (Jigar-Sachin) which is already creating waves on the audio charts. Can't think of a popular disc that doesn't play Party Abhi Baaki Hai, as the grand finale.

So many stalwarts and so little to savour. Can't remember a single song that was incidentally shot in a slipshod manner, including the item number by Sarah Jane Dias. And can't help wonder how Farhan could sign off a film which lacks both soul and substance.  movie  Okay, Game has the looks of a stylish film and is peppered with all the prettiness that goes with big bottom lined bonanzas. The frames look glossy, the locales are exotic and the characters are well coiffured. But they all come across as a bunch of confused souls, caught in a cross-country race, minus conviction. Abhishek's good-bad trapeze act is a jumble; Kangna's cop act is by and large clueless; Boman Irani's corrupt Thai politician act is empty bluster; Anupam Kher's master of the game montage is peripheral; Sarah Jane Dias makes an inconsequential debut as the girl who dies, God-only-knows-why; and otherwise competent actors, Jimmy Shergill and Shahana Goswami are left high and dry in a script that offers them nothing.

In keeping with the contemporary setting, Karnad is a well-placed doctor and a spokesperson for the Bengali bhadralok in Britain.

First is the striking topicality of the film. Like No One Killed Jessica, Monica too draws its flesh and blood from real life drama and is ostensibly inspired by the Shivani Bhatnagar case. Atleast the dramatis personae are the same and include a journalist who becomes a pawn in a political game and ends up losing her life for it. The film unfolds as a thrilling courtroom drama where lawyer Yashpal Sharma tries to nail the politician-industrialist nexus that plotted and perpetrated the murder of the gutsy journalist, Monica Jaitley. The courtroom proceedings are punctuated with flashbacks showcasing Monica's stormy rise from small town scribe to high-stakes investigative journalist who hobnobbed with high-profile powerbrokers like the telecom minister, Chandrakant Pandit and the wheeling-dealing industrialist Pamela Grewal. Of course, somewhere along this meteoric ascent, she leaves behind simpleton husband Rajit Kapoor and all the idyll that is associated with sweet domesticity.  The second thing that stands out in this low-on-hype film are the performances. Almost everyone pitches in a stellar act and creates characters that are credible and intensely human. Monica may be a crime drama, but director Sushen Bhatnagar ensures that nobody is a cold-blooded criminal. If Monica, the protagonist who thinks everything's fair for success and survival, never ends up as the bad girl despite her ambiguous morals, then Chandrakant Pandit is a colossus, even though he kills in cold blood. The film boasts of landmark performances by Divya Dutta and Ashutosh Rana as the movers and the shakers in this murky passion play. Rajit Kapoor's anguish as the cuckolded husband who holds on to his dignity is majestic too. Smaller players like Yashpal Sharma, Kitu Gidwani and Sandeep Misra also manage to grab eyeballs.  Don't be mislead by the title (no, it isn't a morning show film) and don't be foxed by the low key publicity. This one's truly a surprise. Check it out.

If Anupam Kher renders a serious and substantial act as a father who may or may not be guilty, then newcomer Tena Desai is suitably restrained as the troubled daughter, torn between love and truth. Then, there is also Pawan Malhotra to watch out for as the mysterious third angle in this whodunit. All okay, on the acting front at least.  But when it comes to the plot, the pulp begins to flow....The film takes so long to build up to a not-so-predictable climax, it almost enervates you with its sluggishness. The repeated flashbacks with a not-so-happening actor-duo playing out a young Anupam Kher and his wife are meandering and meaningless, as are the daughter's rants about good daddy-bad daddy.  The film does show flashes of substance and form, but there's a whole lot of flab that renders it formless.

Rai","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Been there, done that? Yes, the first thing that strikes you about Tanu Weds Manu is a striking sense of familiarity. It wasn't long before you saw Shahid Kapoor playing a similar sacrificial lover to Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met. And like poor Kareena, who tries too sort out her confused emotions against the backdrop of the big fat Punjabi wedding, Tanu too must decide who is better husband material, first amidst the hustle bustle of her best friend's boisterous going-balle-balle baraat and then at her chaotic Kanpuria community haveli.  movie  But the deja vu doesn't last long. For despite the predictable -- and paper thin -- storyline, the film manages to hook you with its sheer atmospherics. The director creates an extremely busy and colourful canvas brimming with characters who are anything but cardboard cut-outs. If Madhavan fleshes out a heart-tugging, oh-so-lonely and acutely desi NRI, winning you over with his shy smiles and well-mannered chutzpah, then Kangna Ranaut's wild cat rebel is endearing too. The Friends Inc also pitches in an inspired act with the groom's best buddies Deepak Dobriyal and Eijaz Khan adding fun and games to the raucous proceedings. On the bride's side, it is the spunky Payal (Swara Bhaskar) who infuses verve, even while emerging as Kangna's counsel and guide.

Unfortunately, the laughs are too few and far between, as Rajpal Yadav choses to don a serious avatar and Johnny Lever plays it way over the top as the loud goon who is desperate to rule the neighbourhood with his might-is-right mantra. Even Divya Dutta, a fine actor otherwise, is reduced to a caricature as a whining, wailing wife and mother who threatens to throw herself under a train whenever things go amiss.

Or is it Sonal (Maddalsa Sharma) who forgives the man who kills her dad (by default) and later falls in love with him to become his angel? Or is it the blooming romance of the debutants where love is all about the chanting some incoherent Chinese mantra? Whatever it is, you really don't want to know.  Reason? First, is Abhay, who for most part of the movie, is seen moving in and out of jail. Sometimes for two years -- when he hits a man on the road killing him on the spot; sometimes for seven -- when he can't explain his love for the mentally challenged girl who happens to be the daughter of the man he once hit.

All it takes is a family counselling session by a bunch of restless yuppies in Patiala House -- the extended family mansion in Southall -- who urge our hero to rise up against Bauji, the in-house Hitler and realise his dreams. He would thereby set a precedent for the rest of the suppressed souls who would prefer to become chefs, rap artists, film makers and fashion designers rather than churn out jalebis or sing bhajans as per the patriarch's wishes. Of course, the major push -- and inspiration -- comes from the somewhat badnam Munni of Southall, Anushka Sharma, who apart from being a big tease, is an accomplished motivator too.  movie  But yes, it does take too long for the transformation of our hero who moves from the background to the foreground after plodding through a somewhat tedious plot which is bogged down by predictability. Every little twist and turn of this self-realisation soap opera is pre-ordained and terribly familiar. You know our hero is going to stand tall in the final moments of a faltering match, despite the aggro stance of a scowling Andrew Symmonds. You know the great Indian parivar is going to stick together, come what may. And you know Hitler will be all heart after a life-threatening heart attack.  So what stands out in this melee of poorly-sketched characters and a stodgy plot? It's the performances. Akshay Kumar refreshingly dons the actor avatar once again, setting aside his overdone comic hero cloak which had begun to fray with overuse.

First, because it's a living example of what timeless classics actually mean. The film may be almost 50 years old, yet the flavour is mint fresh. There is nothing that feels dated about the film, not even the sartorial style.  The second strong factor that propels you towards it is its message. The strong anti-war undercurrent of Hum Dono remains relevant and even more topical in today's clash-of-civilisation clime. Dev Anand's rhetoric on the irrelevance of war and the horror on the battlefield is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's diatribe in The Great Dictator.

There's always a lot of people running around in knotty circles to grab it and there's always a low premium on honesty and fair play. So get ready for another fair is foul-foul is fair drama that has energetic bits and pieces amidst some mediocre stuff. Questionable too is the narrative structure which might seem innovative to few but gets clunky and incoherent for the average viewer who might just lose patience trying to keep pace with the back and forth jumps.  So what's engaging? Ordinary bloke Vinay Pathak's interludes with mysterious stranger Mona Singh. But the same Vinay Pathak simply blows it as the Pink Panther-like gangster with his unfunny French and his overdone gigs. Equally disengaging is Mahi Gill's moll act which strangely lacks all the spark she displayed in Dev D. Sadly, the actor is still looking for a foothold in Bollywood despite an impressive debut.  Intermittently interesting, Utt Pataang has a problem of plenty. You've seen this so many times in experimental gangster noir.  "},{"Name":"Yeh Saali Zindagi","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Irrfan Khan, Arunoday Singh, Chitrangda Singh, Aditi Rao Hyadri, Saurabh Shukla, Sushant Singh","Director":"Sudhir Mishra","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Sudhir Mishra ain't no stranger to gangster rap. He has already proved his prowess at tackling Bollywood's favourite theme in an earlier cult thriller, Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin, where love exploded against the violent backdrop of the Mumbai underworld. This time, emotions go ballistic in the seamy alleys and shady suburbs of Delhi's underbelly. And yes, the backdrop simply takes your breath away. Mishra's canvas -- and cinematographer (Sachin Kumar Krishnan) -- captures the Capital and it's alluring adjuncts with love and caress, creating stunning visuals of a city that's tranquil in turmoil.  But the picturesque visuals are just one part of the story. More important is the story itself. Mishra's script not only keeps you entertained with its umpteen twists and turns, it also pays due respect to the intelligence of the viewer. Like Kaminey, Yeh Saali Zindagi too expects the viewer to shake off his lethargy, catch the stray dialogue, understand the intonations and figure out the nuances of a screenplay that doesn't believe in spilling all the beans, all at once. The crime thriller unfolds as a narration by lead player, Irrfan Khan, a gangster who works for shady Saurabh Shukla but loses his heart to crooner, Chitrangda. It's a one-sided, totally irrational love affair that not only creates a storm in his ordered life but catapults him towards doom. Equally messed up and running on a parallel track is henchman Arunoday Singh's life, which oscillates between passionate encounters with harried wife, Aditi Rao Hyadri and double-edged dealings with two gangster brothers, Yashpal Sharma and Prashant Narayanan. Add to this a corrupt cop, Sushant Singh, and you have an entire circus of crooks trying to hoodwink each other for the final picking.  It does sound a bit confusing but if you're alert and attentive, you're going to love this merry-go-round. Specially since the ensemble cast breathes fire and passion in their performances. If Irrfan Khan leads the pack with his individual charisma, then Arunoday Singh isn't a step behind with his maverick charms. Both Chitrangda and Aditi too are mercurial with their moves, while Saurabh Shukla's archetypal Delhi-fixer act is fun to watch. Of course, it's hard to ignore another important facet of the film"},{"Name":"Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Ajay Devgn, Emraan Hashmi, Omi Vaidya, Shazahn Padamsee, Shruti Haasan, Tisca Chopra, Shraddha Das","Director":"Madhur Bhandarkar","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 23 minutes","Review":" Madhur Bhandarkar tries to change tracks. He attempts a switch-over from serious, hard-hitting cinema that chooses to expose the underbelly of society to a light-hearted look at the affairs of the heart. Does he succeed? Well, partially so. For Dil To Baccha Hai Ji may have its heart in the right place but the tone is a bit tenuous and the comedy only intermittently breezy.  movie  Each of the three love tracks have their pros and cons. The highpoint of Ajay Devgn's romance is Ajay Devgn of course. The actor does look visibly uncomfortable with all that talk of virginity and when-did-you-lose-it business and actually brings out the guffaws when he breaks into a '70s ballad at a yuppie party. Emraan's dil dosti story stands out for its gleeful dirty rotten scoundrel act and for the sheer dignity that Tisca Chopra adds to the predator woman cameo. With Omi Vaidya, you know what's there to smile about"},{"Name":"Hostel","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Vatsal Seth, Tulip Joshi, Mukesh Tiwari","Director":"Manish Gupta","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 55 minutes","Review":" Bollywood is borrowing heavily from reality. And that's a good sign. For cinema that talks about real problems is indeed, cinema of substance. After the Jessica murder case having seen a screen interpretation recently, we have the Aman Kachru ragging incident finding an echo in Manish Gupta's Hostel. The film enters the closed rooms of a boy's hostel to unveil the atrocities that are committed inside, all in the name of fun and timepass.  The drama opens with a no-holds-barred depiction of the brutal ragging that is prevalent in several Indian colleges. Senior student Mukesh Tiwari and his cronies unleash their terror on the vulnerable new students and subject them to both physical and mental torture. And they seem to do it with impunity since no one in the administration is willing to take punitive action against the errant bunch. The initial sequences of abuse are actually hair-raising and make you cringe in disgust. But soon, the drama peters off into a tepid love story between the victim (Vatsal Seth) and a friendly Tulip Joshi who wants to bunk classes and go on a holiday with her boyfriend.  That's okay too. But the climax definitely isn't. The ragged student's remedy for the scourge does seem misplaced and quite-quite formula-ridden. Surely, there has to be a better way to resolve the ills of the world in contemporary cinema than resort to cliches. Wish the director and story writer had found a more realistic resolution to a real problem.  This apart, the film does make you sit up and raise a fist against the most prevalent malady of our education system.

It's the alienation index of the migrants who come from different places and different walks of life in search of lebensraum. Some come looking for livelihood, like Munna, the young dhobi who literally washes the dirty laundry of the sprawling neighbourhood. Some are on the prowl for connections, meanings, matters of the heart, like Shai. Some, like the artist Arun, serenade Mumbai and its myriad moods as the eternal muse that finds expression on his blank canvas. And some, like Yasmin, keep seeking for something as simple as happiness and quiet domesticity in a crumbling marriage. But all of them are essentially lost souls, lonely souls, longing souls....  movie  Dhobi Ghat is a compelling picture of urban angst that has become the hallmark of big city life. The experiences of the four diverse characters may be varied, but they all have a similar theme. It's a somewhat dysfunctional foursome, desperately seeking an anchor in the shifting sands of a maddening city. Arun openly confesses he is a loner and doesn't try to hide his discomfort on finding Shai trying to get comfortable in his pad, the morning after. Shai spends her sabbatical trying to connect with Munna, her washerman, despite their different backgrounds, when all she'll like to do was finish the unfinished business that lingers between her and Arun. Munna, on his part, is tormented by his passion for the uptown woman he can never hope to hook up with. But it is the existential trauma of the newly married Yasmin which strikes you the most, as the woman pours out her loneliness in video letters to her brother Imran....Letters that become the leitmotif of a crumbling city's soul.  Kiran Rao makes a sensitive debut with Dhobi Ghat, a film that is heavily imbued with mood and soul. She uses her characters smartly to dissect the much talked about spirit of Mumbai without getting maudlin. In fact, the high point of the film is its understated elegance as the lead players slip in and out of the frame, chasing dreams and aspirations. If Aamir Khan enunciates the art of understatement through his delineation of Arun, the women (Monica Dogra and Kriti Malhotra) skillfully juxtapose strength and vulnerability. Prateik's Munna is endearing, despite being a bit too chic for the average neighbourhood dhobi. But eventually, it is the fifth character that overwhelms you with its colours and mercurial mood swings. And that's Maximum City, Mumbai.

Everybody seems to be running around in circles and Mumbai's magical allure becomes almost farcical. Equally unfunny is the spoof on Amitabh Bachchan, his films and his Kaun Banega Crorepati show.

Once again, in Yamla Pagla Deewana, Dharam Singh (Dharmendra) and his sons Paramveer Singh (Sunny Deol) and Gajodhar Singh (Bobby Deol) are the oddball family which win you over with their goofy attempts to bridge their differences and bond, first on the picturesque ghats of Benares and then in the burlesque backwaters of Punjab.  movie  The film is meant to showcase the Deol charisma. And that it manages to do, despite a clumsy first-half and a stodgy script. The brawny threesome does manage to transcend the flaws in the narrative and create some comic moments with their earthy, rustic, pulsating Punjabiyat exploding full throttle. If Sunny replays his gentle giant machismo, then Bobby carries on his prankster lover-boy image, even as he pitches in as dad's favourite son, buddy and partner-in-crime.

The two-film (Kalyug and A Wednesday) old girl manages to hold your attention with her earthy act of a gutsy middle class Maharashtrian computer wizard who may be low on social skills but doesn't lack brain -- and brawn -- despite her apparent timidity.  Vikalp also boasts of an unconventional story which sees our super girl battling a gang of terrorists who are running a covert IT firm to support their illegal acts. It's a topical tale of how technology and techies are being misused to run the state-of-the-art terror factory that's spread its tentacles all over the globe. But the drama lacks punch and gets too long drawn in places. Also, the romance and the song and dance frills were totally unnecessary. As long as a be-spectacled Rishika is battling with codes and binary numbers, the film keeps rolling. But when she's day dreaming in fantasy romantic sequences, it stalls heavily. A bit of chopping, sifting and editing would have worked wonders for the film. Nevertheless, this is a brave Vikalp (choice) for Deepal in a film world that mostly has little to offer to the female lead.

If an outlaw could write a holy scripture (Ramayana) and lay down the moral code for society, then why can't a writer become an outlaw and purge society, even if it means picking up the gun and going trigger happy. The logic defies you, as does the film which sees the hero (Ayaan Ahmad) indulging in just two things. He is either involved in heavy philosophical discussions with his parents (Rahul Roy and Ayesha Julka) on ethics and eventuality or else, he is rushing in an out of a gangster's den and shooting down indiscriminate people. Ostensibly, these are all crooks and criminals who need to be taught a lesson. In between the grave discussions and the gun play, the sad-looking protagonist finds some time to romance a girl from nowhere (Nauheed Cyrusi) and sing a few soulful songs (AR Rahman) with her.  It's a well-intentioned film. You can see the filmmaker is voicing a lament against the declining moral code of modern society. Too many people breaking too many laws and no one being held to account. Time for a messiah, he seems to be wanting to say. But sadly, the message and the meaning gets lost in translation. What remains is the stylisation of the film and the music.  "},{"Name":"Isi Life Mein","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Akshay Oberoi, Sandeepa Dhar, Mohnish Behl, Prachi Shah","Director":"Vidhi Kasliwal","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours 20 minutes","Review":" The house of Barjatya's carries on its task of upholding India's moral and cultural code by reiterating its earlier code of conduct for young Indians. In all Barjatya films, the heroines never show skin, never get physical, never give up their undertones, never question authority, never argue, never debate, never lose their cool and never think of getting a life, on their own. According to them, parents know best, personal ambitions are perfunctory, questioning authority is heresy.  Isi Life Mein does have an interesting premise and tries to present the other point of view. The film tries to say that modernity isn't synonymous with sin and metro kids are sorted out too, despite their strange dress sense and stranger lingo. The film even has the virginal heroine asking the hero his views on sex before marriage. Of course, she fumbles before using the S-word, just as she asks her friend to gargle after using the F-word. (And yes, the friend does gargle!!!).  But somewhere along, the intention gets all mixed up. This holier-than-thou attitude could have been tolerable if our puritanical lady had shown some spunk at least. The film ostensibly tries to speak on behalf on India's Gen Now, but the submissiveness of the heroine simply doesn't work. The girl doesn't once object, question, protest despite being forced to forget her love, her ambitions, her dreams and marry a complete stranger. Can't understand what's wrong in saying No.  This apart, the film unfolds as one long play rehearsal and doesn't seem to move forward after a point. The relationship between the big city boy and the small town girl is confined to an exchange of smiles and smiles and some more smiles"},{"Name":"Toonpur Ka Superhero","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Ajay Devgn, Kajol, Sanjay Mishra","Director":"Kireet Khurana","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"1 hour 36 minutes","Review":" a bunch of ogres and ugly creatures.

If Main Hoon Naa had a delightful sense of fun permeating through the college campus where most of the drama unfolded, then Om Shanti Om used Bollywood's favourite theme -- reincarnation -- with a sparkling, tongue-in-cheek tenor that made the implausible end up as uproarious fun. Tees Maar Khan too is purported to be total fun and begins on a promising note, with the actors creating havoc on screen from the word go. Unborn Akshay kicking in his Bollywood-crazy mother's womb, all grown-up Akshay breaking the law and bragging about it in bindaas style, dim-witted Anya (Katrina) doing the Sheela Ki Jawani number with aplomb and basking in her B-grade starlet status, an edgy superstar (Akshaye Khanna) tearing his hair apart for having missed the Oscar to Anil Kapoor's Slumdog Millionaire act...you begin to settle down for loads of masti and dhamaal as the show unfolds.  movie  But post interval, you end up restless. And fidgety. Because nothing really connects. The film maker has always treated Bollywood cinema with a fond irreverence and has laughed at many of the sacrosanct givens of the mainstream formula. But all the jokes and the jibes have been incorporated in a storyline and a screenplay that has always managed to have an emotional connect, like old-fashioned Hindi cinema has. Main Hoon Naa reiterated the bhai-bhai bond and OSO applauded the eternal love story that seems to be staple Bollywood fare. Sadly, Tees Maar Khan begins as a spoof and remains a spoof, till the very end. All the characters end up as mere caricatures and completely fail to build up an emotional quotient in the film. The protagonist, Tees Maar Khan, ends up as a much-applauded character in the film, but you don't feel like putting your hands together for him because even his con act leaves you cold. Katrina Kaif's Anya is the strangest heroine act till now. Completely over the top and completely brainless, she has nothing alluring about her, till the very end. All she does is rant, rave and live up to the dumb girlfriend/item girl stereotype, donning rollers in her hair and declaring `You dirty dog' over and over again. The only exaggeration that seems to work here is Akshaye Khanna. He plays the Oscar-crazy superstar as a hysterical madcap and somehow manages to pull off the joke. A complete surprise act from the generally staid and sober Akshaye Khanna!  The film might have worked if it had buffered its spoof-and-satire stance with some emotional drama too. For there is only this much you can laugh at Danny Boyle becoming Danny Doyle and Manoj Night Shyamalan becoming Manoj Day Ramalan. If the drama fails to touch you, the music (Vishal-Shekhar) doesn't remain with you too long. Of course Sheela Ki Jawani is eye-popping chartbuster fare and adds another definition to the item number with Katrina's explosive rendition. But eventually, fun needs a foundation too and spoofs need some substance to carry them through. TMK has colour, humour, pace but nothing does seem to fall in place in terms of plot and character connect.  "},{"Name":"Mirch","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Konkona Sen Sharma, Arunoday Singh, Raima Sen, Shahana Goswami, Shreyas Talpade","Director":"Vinay Shukla","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Now when was the last time you saw a Bollywood film dissecting female sexuality without being apologetic about it? Can't remember, can you? Bollywood has mostly turned its back to the sensual woman as a protagonist. Typically, there have been just two ways mainstream cinema has viewed female eroticism. By and large, the Indian film heroine is represented as a romantic, albeit asexual creature, who is terribly low on oestrogen. And in case she doesn't have an hormonal imbalance, she is straight-jacketed into the whore and vamp category. The Sex And The City sisterhood has still to find a place in Indian cinema.  Vinay Shukla tries to undo this lapse by delving into four tales where the woman seeks out sexual satisfaction on her own terms. Having earlier made Godmother, another woman-oriented film, the director does seem to have an adequate understanding of the female psyche. All his four stories have a delightful and cheeky charm to them. Two of the stories feature Raima Sen as the protagonist as she enjoys a bit on the side, first as a carpenter's (Raghubir Yadav) wife and then as a modern woman who finds a lover, just to spite her suspicious husband (Shreyas Talpade). The other two focus on Konkona Sen Sharma's naughty escapades, first as an unsatiated young queen of yore and then as a shrewd wife of a philandering husband (Boman Irani). Add to this the turbulent romance between the scriptwriter and his girlfriend (Shahana Goswami) and you have a film that holds your attention. But not completely....  The garbled end and the misconstrued tenor of the film do act as a deterrent. Even as the women seem to be enjoying themselves with their unbridled expression of their sexual needs, the film tends to view them as the traditional not-to-be-trusted temptress. Overlook that and you can enter a world where women indeed are full-bodied flesh and blood characters. Both Raima and Konkona are a treat.

Mahesh Pandey wanted to make a serious film on a serious issue but ironically all you get to hear a string of endless beeps, as the censor board seems to have snipped off every word that pertains to the issue and could have angered certain sections, according to it. So what if the film is ostensibly trying to talk about national integration and takes a stand against all kinds of divisive caste and regional politics. The bottomline being that whenever the North Indians and the Maharashtrians indulge in a verbal duel -- which forms the crux of the screenplay -- there is blip, beep, blip in lieu of conversation.  This apart, the film is a flat narration of an event with no attempt at character building and dramatic rendering. Also, the hurried and cluttered connection of the anti-migrants agitation with 26/11 makes no sense at all.

And what a delightful smattering of colours is spilling forth as film makers try to understand what makes the Indian capital -- with its amalgam of cultures and communities -- so charismatic.  movie  Band Baaja Baaraat works smartly as a sociological study of saddi Dilli, with moods, moments and characters that crisply capture the life on the other side of the neon lights. Like Dibakar Banerjee and Rakeysh Mehra, director Maneesh Sharma chooses to look the other way and talk about the earthy, emotional, rough-edged quintessential Dilliwala who peppers his language with street talk, doesn't believe in minding his Ps and Qs, revels in an in-your-face attitude and cocks a snook at the HS (high-society) people...Only because he thinks he ain't less than them, any which way. Bittu and Shruti are unabashedly Janakpuri types. And that is what makes them so warm and vibrant. They meet in DTC buses, gorge themselves on ice candy at India Gate and discuss `binnas' (business) plans on bread pakoras. And yes, high strung and emotional blokes that they are, they do the disco at the drop of a hat, hug tightly when things go right and fight rough when misunderstandings begin.  As long as you view Band Baaja Baaraat as a loving, heartfelt take on what makes Delhi go dhak-dhak, the film holds your attention. The screenplay and the dialogues (Habib Faisal) are spilling over with recognisable nuances and emotions. When Bittu refers to their romantic interlude as a `kaand', a mistake, you cannot help smiling. But when you begin to view the film as a new age romance, it becomes somewhat awkward and rough, primarily because the lead couple can hardly light up the screen with passion and pyaar. As they rightly lay down the rules at the very beginning"},{"Name":"Rakta Charitra 2","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Vivek Oberoi, Suriya, Priyamani, Sudeep, Radhika Apte","Director":"Ram Gopal Varma","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 20 minutes","Review":" The first few reels of the film are devoted to a recap where the director tries to introduce newbies to Rakht Charitra Part 1. And it's all done in a fast forward manner which makes the violence and the high-octane drama even more hysterical. Quite irritating. But soon, the film settles down to somewhat new territory where the story follows a similar format, albeit in a slightly more gripping manner.  Thematically, the drama unfolds in a familiar guns and gore fashion, where one bloody attack is followed by another as the two protagonists, Pratap and Surya, battle it out for supremacy and survival. But the violence is choreographed stylistically, the camera angles are unconventional and the action cuts explode in slow motion, adding a surrealistic touch to the killing fields of small town India. Also, this time, the characters manage to connect with the audience, because the chopping and blasting is interspersed with a bit of drama and dialogue. Here and there, you do manage to get a few emotive sequences between Surya and his wife Bhawani or between Pratap and his wife Nandini. And yes, there is also a high voltage encounter between Surya and Pratap where the two blood-lusting enemies engage in a verbal duel instead of drawing blood.  But eventually, the film is essentially about revenge -- a dish best served bloody -- and the cycle of violence which leaves nobody spotless and clean. Ram Gopal Varma makes no bones about depicting Indian politics in its ugly, brutish form, where there is a complete disregard for law and constitutional propriety. Both Vivek Oberoi and Suriya pitch in a powerful act as the eyes-blood-shot brigands, while Sudeep and Shatrughan Sinha flit in and out, mostly as bystanders. The film essentially belongs to the action director (Javed-Aejaz), since it is basically a montage of finely-crafted, high-on-adrenalin action sequences.  Rakht Charitra doesn't break new ground like Satya and Company, nevertheless it remains a must-see film for Ramu fans.

On April 18, 1930, they simultaneously attack several British outposts -- the armoury, the cantonment,the telegraph office, the European club -- with their indigenous bombs, weapons and raw valour.

And if you can translate Obama's `Yes We Can' anthem into a bunch of small time hoodlums' war cry, then you got to be extra smart. And that's what smarty-pants director Subhash Kapoor manages to do with his smart-alec cast of actors who bring to life a roll call of characters that make you chuckle with glee.  movie  From the Big Apple to the backwaters of small town India, this comedy of errors lives and breathes fire through its colourful characters and its witty screenplay. Unlike the usual run-of-the-mill comedies which Bollywood thrives on, Phas Gaye... makes you laugh because of its zany situations, rather than elicit canned laughter by making people slip over banana peels, go scatological or hit and pinch each other insanely. If Om Shastri is a conniving wheeler-dealer from Amreeka, then Bhaisaheb (Sanjay Mishra) is the local dada who is bogged down by the `mandee' (recession) in his business of extortion and kidnapping.

There are noisy, boisterous, zany, crazy, conventional, unconventional romantic soirees rushing down the assembly line every week. If Break ke Baad manages to hold your attention, despite its plodding middle, it's only because it speaks in a different tone altogether. Danish Aslam's debut film may be a love story, but there is an underplay, a restraint and a sense of non-drama (the opposite of dramebaaz) that speaks directly to you.

Faruk Kabir too may have been inspired by the landmark classic but his idiom and his interpretation of child exploitation is completely his own.  The film is a hard-hitting, gritty account of growing up in a dangerous place where all talk of ideals and values seems irrelevant. Vijay and Yakub would like to lead the good life too, but does life give them a chance to choose their ethics? The duo are almost involuntarily sucked into the matrix of crime and violence, which leads them from the dark slums to the darker reform home where the Fagin-like warden (Naseeruddin Shah) and his minions transform them into complete crooks.

A smart little fable that kinda explains why Indians erect temples for their favourite stars or write fan mail to them in blood.  Set against a crumbling bustee in Mumbai, the film revolves around a traffic signal where a bunch of small-timers live and love. And against this colourful backdrop of fringe folks, Shah Rukh Khan (in a special appearance) accidentally unleashes a Devdas-ish folklore, where book-seller John (Sanjay) pines for his own Paro (Pritika) who has eyes only for her DDLJ hero SRK, while the friendly neighbourhood hooker (Choyoti) doubles up as the local Chandramukhi and tries her best to seduce the reluctant Romeo.  Makarand Deshpande has already made his name in theatre and has almost always pitched in an arresting cameo in his screen avtar. With Shah Rukh Bola...he makes an interesting debut as a film director and holds out promise for the future. The film does have a few rough edges and needs a bit of editing.

Firstly, because it follows a film craft that is akin to pure art. Film maker, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his cinematographer (Sudeep Chatterjee) have created a collage of riveting paintings on screen, where both the interiors of a crumbling mansion and the outsides of an incandescent Goa landscape literally transport you to an art gallery. The exquisite detailing of Aishwarya's daily chores as she brushes her patient's teeth, shampoos his hair, scratches his nose, cleans his bed sores or simply draws the blinds to keep the sunlight out is mesmerising to watch, even as their rare outdoor soirees blind you with their exuberance. Catch Hrithik and Aishwarya enjoying a drive down the uninhibited Goan countryside and you can actually feel the breeze rustle through your hair....  movie  But more unusual is the spirit of the film which supposedly articulates a plea for death but ends up serenading life and love with tenderness and restraint. Ethan may be plagued by his immobility and languishing body, but his eyes dance like a dervish.

Even the production values of the film are okay, considering that Indian cinema hardly pays attention to children's films and, unlike Hollywood, almost always treats it as a poor cousin to mainstream fare.  But somewhere along, the film loses its plot and becomes a lack lustre string of action sequences meant to showcase the muscles of Ramaa, the savior (Saahil Khan) who surprisingly, has nothing much to say. Is he the country cousin of Tarzan? Can't tell because there isn't a Jane around. Unless you'd like to opt for a Lara Croftish Tanushree Dutta as Jane of the Jungle. As for Khali, he's hardly there....which means most of the kids are going to end up disappointed because there's hardly any WWF fare to cheer about.

And director Vipul Shah seems to have got his research right on the glorious 1970s, when go-go girls romanced bell-bottomed guys with the twist, the shake and the tube-burst of colours. Stylistically, Action Replayy is a fun watch and sets the 70s generation on a nostalgia binge, even as it opens up an exotic window to a vibrant new world for a whole new generation of new millennium kids. The long-haired Akshay and the pig-tailed Aishwarya bring back the pyar-mohabbat (romance) ishtyle from the past. And the retro idiom works....But only till a point.  movie  The problem with Action Replayy is the going-nowhere humour track. The gags aren't too funny and the tu-tu main-main between Akshay and Aishwarya borders on the juvenile. The film perks up only when son Bunty manages to do a make-over of his dopey dad and Akshay emerges in his more dapper avatar as the archetypal hero who has just one job at hand. He must tame the shrew (Aishwarya) who has been tormenting him for long and turn her into wife material. And that's a task which needs to be urgently done, since there's a rival in love (Rannvijay), waiting in the wings to lure the vixen into his lair.  The film is obviously inspired by Robert Zememkis' 1985 film, Back To The Future, where teenager Michael J. Fox had a similar job at hand. But must we need to tell you which one was better....Action Replayy needed a much smarter script to keep the laughter ringing. Akshay Kumar desperately needs to get back to his action replay if he really wants to re-energise his franchise. The goofy common man act isn't working anymore, simply because of an overkill. Sadly, veterans like Kirron Kher and Om Puri too don't have much to do, although they do manage to elicit a few laughs, here and there.

If Golmaal-l was sheer fun, the second in the series took a slight dip in terms of merriment. Thankfully, Golmaal 3 sets the graph right by revving up the laughter meter and providing a perfect Diwali getaway for viewers who are hungry for some hungama this festive season.  movie  Of course, it's a no-brainer comedy and isn't meant for people who prefer wisdom in wit too. And only the foolish would go hunting for a meaning in the madcap antics that explode on the screen as the ensemble cast assiduously sets aside the high brow for slapstick.  But no one's complaining. Because Ajay Devgn's angry explosions, Tusshar Kapoor's verbal antics, Arshad Warsi's rougish revelry, Sanjay Mishra's delightful mis-spellings...are all rib-tickling stuff.

The actor who enunciated the quintessential tapori in Hindi cinema now plays the saintly miracle man in Maalik Ek. And surprisingly, he plays it well, with a restraint and an earthiness that brings alive the seer.  The film is essentially a chronicle of the miraculous incidents that marked the life of people who interacted with the sage and ended up becoming his devotees. But more importantly, it shows the protagonist espousing a secularism that is desperately needed in today's India. When his devotees ended up fighting with each other on his religious affiliations and his antecedents, Sai Baba gave them a sermon on the essential unity of man. Who's a Hindu and who's a Muslim? he yelled and espoused the 'Maalik Ek' (One God) philosophy to the warring factions.  There is a warmth and simplicity in the narration, although the over abundance of songs and commentary does act as a deterrent. This one's a biography that's essentially meant for the believers.

More importantly, there seems to be some confusion about what our young hero (Shubh) actually wants to be. Does he want to be a gamer, excelling in playstation antics or does he aspire to be a new age Salim-Javed, writing bestselling scripts for blockbuster films? We're as confused as the laddie's lost lady (Sabina Sheema) who tries hard to lure him away from the game console. And when he does, he ends up with strange producers who keep paying him money for a film that never hits the floors.  Flummoxed? Yes. So are we. The film perks up only in the action cuts when Milind Soman leaps and bounds across the screen in hot pursuit of the necklace chor. But that's not enough to keep up the momentum in a film that's in desperate need of editing and punch. Also, what's Anupam Kher doing in a two-bit role that doesn't justify his presence in any way.

Of course it doesn't stand up to the original in any way. But we aren't complaining. And that's primarily because the story has been suitably `Indianised' and adapted to the bitter sweet Indian reality and has a strong local flavour to it. Set against the non-descript little hamlet in the Himalayas, the film captures the irony of mofussil middle class life quite well. What does a poorly-paid school teacher do with a glistening new car that obviously guzzles petrol and needs some decent roads to run on?  So you have our enterprising, never-say-die protagonist using the car for any and every conceivable enterprise he can think of. But each time, he fumbles and fails, much to the discomfiture of his grumbling wife and his disapproving young son. Adding to his woes are his crumbling fortunes and the greedy local leader who has his eyes set on the flashy new limo which meets sundry hiccups (read accidents) as it tries to negotiate the dusty hill roads and the amateur drivers.  Daayen ya Baayen works because of the authenticity of its backdrop and the realistic performances by the motley cast. Deepak Dobriyal's depiction of the protagonist is vibrant and full of verve, even as there's something so endearing about his constantly nagging wife, his feisty mother, his skeptical sister-in-law and his precocious little son who wonders why dad is the quintessential joker of the pack. There are quite a few endearing father and son sequences which make you chuckle with glee. The rest of the characters too are archetypal village blokes and instil a sense of realism in the drama. The film does need to be tightened and snipped in places as it tends to ramble on and on.

In terms of characters, drama and emotions, they are the quintessential potboilers that can never go wrong.... Unless they end up in the hands of unimaginative animators who are hell-bent on transforming the epical tales into boring, inanimate sermons. Now haven't we seen so many of these films, of late?  But wait. Here comes an animation film that breaks the mould completely and makes you sit back and savour the eternal superhero story that's told with Spielbergian panache. So many things work in favour of Chetan Desai's Ramayana. First, there is the 3D animation, which is vibrant, colourful and is a fine blend of calendar and pop art. Rama in ebullient blue tones, Sita in delicate white, Ravana in grimacing brown and Hanuman in his larger-than-life avatar are all great lookers. Second, the voice-overs are given special attention, just like Hollywood films. If Manoj Bajpai and Juhi Chawla lend an equanimity to the characters of Rama and Sita with their soft undertones, then Ashutosh Rana razzle-dazzles with his over-the-top rendition of Ravana. Mukesh Rishi's Hanuman too has the perfect tenor of the perfect devotee. But more than all this, it is the special effects of the film that sizzle and crackle. Hanuman's flying soirees, Rama's encounters with sea gods and serpents, the boisterous battle sequences are all spectacle and fun. Even the language is not Sankritised and strikes a chord with the aam aadmi.  Shred of all sermons, Ketan Mehta's (producer) Ramayana works like magical pop art"},{"Name":"Aakrosh","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"4.0/5","Cast":"Ajay Devgan, Akshaye Khanna, Bipasha Basu, Paresh Rawal","Director":"Priyadarshan","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 55 minutes","Review":" Priyadarshan takes a break from his staple diet of comedies and moves to serious territory with Aakrosh. Now this isn't an alien zone for the filmmaker who has already proved his forte with tackling themes of gravitas in films like Gardish, Virasat, Kala Paani and his National Award winner, Kanjeevaram. In Aakrosh, he goes topical with his attempts to unveil the horror of the recent spate of honour killings, which have relentlessly made headlines. The disappearance of the three college boys in the small hamlet is linked with a love affair that goes sour due to the insurmountable caste barriers that govern social life in this not-so-distant terrain. What follows is a deafening culture of silence and a brutal cover up where anybody who dares to speak up is summarily done away with by the caretakers"},{"Name":"Knock Out","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Sanjay Dutt, Irrfan Khan, Kangna Ranaut","Director":"Mani Shankar","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"1 hour 50 minutes","Review":" Will the barrel of a gun trigger change or will conscience call for it"},{"Name":"Lava Kusa","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Voice of Arun Govil, Vindoo Dara Singh","Director":"Dhavala Satyam","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" The film is too long. The language is too archaic. The animation is too flat. The narrative has too many songs. The action sequences lack testosterone.  Sad. Because here was a story that lent itself to such great drama. You can almost see a Steven Spielberg or a James Cameron salivating at the prospect of rendering such an epic tale -- two young sons taking on the might of their all-powerful dad -- on celluloid. Not to say that we are short of talent in our country. Both in terms of animation technology and celluloid skills, the Indian film industry is brimming over with new energy, new hope.  So, why can't we break the mould when it comes to capturing our mythologicals on screen? Why must we still be stuck with the medieval mindset when rendering Rama, Sita, Radha, Krishna, Hanuman, Ganesha as celluloid heroes? In terms of dramatic potential, there can be nobody who can stand up to them. Not even Superman. So why can't we boast of a superhero film that has the chutzpah of the Superman-Batman Inc?  Think about it.  "},{"Name":"Crook","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Emraan Hashmi, Neha Sharma, Arjan Bajwa","Director":"Mohit Suri","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Crook scores due to its extreme topicality. Director Mohit Suri picks up a tale drawn straight from the current headlines and narrates it with characteristic grit and edginess. It's a familiar playground for Emraan Hashmi too as he gets to essay the role of the enfant terrible all over again. And that isn't rocket science for Emraan, since ever since he hit the marquee with his maniacal act in Murder, the actor has been antsy on screen in almost all his avatars. Even his last outing on screen was a reincarnation of the grimy Dawood-ish don in Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai.  In Crook, he re-essays a character he's already played earlier in Jannat. Emraan's cabbie-man act in Crook sees him going through the entire graph of a callous bad boy turning good. But before he can set aside his amoral ways, he must take the rough ride on the streets of Melbourne which are buzzing with an underground war between Indian and Aussie gangs, baying for each other's blood. The Indian students find a leader in the hot-headed Arjan Bajwa who is determined to uphold desi culture in phoren shores, even as the Australian goonda insists on protecting his native culture from the foreign onslaught.  It's here that Mohit presents a new take on the issue. He depicts both of them -- the Indian and the Australian -- as equally racist and argues for introspection on both sides. Of course, eventually, it's left to Emraan Hashmi to play mediator between the two warring camps and douse the fire that threatens to burn down the neighbourhood. Time for the crook to change colours and turn hero....  The film isn't a smooth ride altogether. Unlike Kalyug , Mohit's earlier film, Crook begins on an incoherent note and takes time to get its focus right. Most of the first half of the film is spent -- and wasted -- in the romantic escapades of Emraan with the Indian student and the Australian night club dancer. The story picks up mostly in the second half and makes a meaningful noise"},{"Name":"Do Dooni Chaar","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Rishi Kapoor, Neetu Singh, Archit Krishna, Aditi Vasudev","Director":"Habib Faisal","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 50 minutes","Review":" Sweet, simplistic and sensitive"},{"Name":"Anjaana Anjaani","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Zayed Khan","Director":"Siddharth Anand","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" They meet as strangers in the night.... The possibilities are immense. Is director Siddharth Anand able to leverage this great opportunity and tell an engaging story about two people who find life and love on the threshold of death? Errr, umm, well, he does, but partially so.  movie  Let's get things straight. By and large, we have no complaints with that critical quotient called chemistry. The new pairing of Ranbir and Priyanka manages to create some wild and whacky moments on screen as they romance each other with the archetypal yuppie attitude. The relationship begins on an antagonistic note and then shifts into a whole new terrain of quirky need. The two need each other to help each other die! So you have a handful of delightful scenes where the duo fumble and falter in their bid to asphyxiate each other by tying plastic tape on each other's faces. Doesn't work; so they decide to defer the death plan by a few weeks and fill the rest of their days with crazy stuff.... Like swimming in the middle of the Atlantic in sub zero conditions or finding a suitable partner for Ranbir who is desperate to officially come of age, before curtain call.

The film maker raises a paean for the bechari bar girls (Rukhsar and Co) who all have sob stories of their own. Someone's slaving for a sick dad, another for a brood of siblings or trying to cope with the woes of single motherhood. But all of them are a diehard sisterhood that stands by each other in terms of distress. Compare this with the heartless, value-less high class hooker and you know where our film maker's loyalties lie.  Too moralistic, too judgmental, Benny and Babloo doggedly treads the trodden path, filling you with viewer fatigue.

Don't worry if you haven't heard about it, 'cause you actually haven't missed much. Anyways, language is irrelevant in this film, which mostly unfolds through a screenplay peppered with grunts, roars and shrieks.  The hapless threesome is forced to spend nights and days, locked up in a jeep, while the lions maul and chomp on anyone who tries to get near them, including two local hunters. The poor souls end up as lion grub, all because they wanted to get the Americanos some water. Strangely, they leave the threesome alone, even though the women dare to venture out, now and then. That is, when they are not squabbling, for the hungry lions hovering outside aren't the only bugbear for this dysfunctional family. The teenage daughter harbours a resentment against her wannabe stepmom too and isn't ready to call it truce so easily. Not until the woman proves she's mommy material by braving the lions and their bloodied incisors.  Watchable, while it lasts, Shikar The Lion is B-grade Discovery fare.

After all, the dilemma between fulfilling hard-headed career goals and meeting the demands of gender role play (playing perfect wife and super mom) confronts many an alpha woman today. Hence successful banker, Rituparna Sengupta's choice of opting for a womb on hire (Divya Dutta), until she has the time -- and the inclination -- for being a biological mother, doesn't seem so alarmist to us.  But hey, are we in a minority here? It's hard to understand why the film makers actually had to take up such a modern topic, if they actually wanted to go antique in tone and mindset. The poor woman is made to feel so guilty for turning her back to unplanned motherhood and the careerist in her is painted as a slur on all womanhood. So much so, the much-accoladed corporate honcho is made to sit forlorn with her awards and citations, while the rotund and resplendent surrogate mom celebrates the joys of pregnancy and is called upon to deliver a monologue on merry motherhood to the mistaken corporate hussy who actually dares to believe that anatomy isn't destiny!  Apart from the regressive tenor, the film takes a turn into no-man's land in the second half. Sad, because it actually begins on an interesting note, where it captures the highs and lows of an overworked urban couple trying their best to balance home and career. But post-interval, it bullock-carts into a village, peopled with starving, jobless folk who sell their wombs to feed their children. Totally unnecessary, this sob story on rural decay.  End result? Life Express is a confused attempt that doesn't know whether to celebrate the modern woman or condemn her. We'd suggest, you celebrate her success and her choices.  "},{"Name":"For Real","Release Time":"May 4 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Sarita Chowdhury, Adil Hussain, Sameer Dharmadhikari, Zoya S Hassan, Sriharsh Sharma Churai","Director":"Sona Jain","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"1 hour 20 minutes","Review":" Director Sona Jain makes an elegant debut with a sensitively crafted film on domestic strife and its detrimental effects on the psyche of vulnerable young minds. Anchoring her story in an upmarket Delhi household, the filmmaker tells a fine story of familial break-ups, heartbreak and longing through the eyes of a six-year-old. Indeed, a refreshing new take on domestic discord and the happy-unhappy family syndrome that has regularly featured as Bollywood's favourite plot. But, unlike the traditional narrative of typical Hindi cinema, For Real steers clear of all cliches and creates a recognizable urbane world that can be actually taken for real.  The problems are familiar. While dad (Adil Hussain) is a busy and successful doctor, mom, Priya Shukla (Sarita Chowdhury) gives up her career as a singer to look after the home and nurture the two kids, Paras and Shruti. Somewhere down the tedium of tending to homework, grocery bills, husbands laundry, she discovers she's given up too much -- ambition, career goals, talent, music, money, fame -- and is left behind, a mere bystander, meant to merely applause her boorish husband's success. All her angst pours out, one tumultuous night, even as her little girl watches the violence, hysteria and acrimonious exchange between her feuding parents with wide-eyed dismay from behind the door. Needless to say, she remains wide-eyed and very angry when mom returns after a prolonged separation. Fuelled by her brother's bedtime stories on aliens, she believes her real mom's been hijacked to the Orion galaxy by this new short-haired alien avatar who is hell bent on harming her. Shruti must find her way to Orion and rescue mom before the alien takes over the household....  Indeed, an arduous task! But young Zoya adds a sparkle and verve to her portrayal of the angry, embittered and lonely six-year-old who has nobody to confide in, except her psychiatrist uncle (Sameer Dharmadhikari). But Zoya isn't alone in stealing your heart with her performance. Sarita Chowdhury pitches in a finely-etched portrayal of the archetypal urban woman who is forced to choose between home and career and ends up embittered with a sense of loss and betrayal. Add to this, a fine music score by Zakir Hussain and a completely non-filmy approach to story-telling and character-building and you have a film that scores well on the freshness and reality quotient. Watch it for the new approach towards a familiar subject.

It's loud, crazy, zany, exaggerated, larger-than-life, almost nonsensical, totally make-believe, comic book like, complete kitsch, generously peppered with the mandatory desi tadka (garnishing) of songs and dances that keep popping out of nowhere and is literally oozing with star charisma. Most importantly, it's not meant to make sense. It's only meant to entertain. And entertain, it does in overdoses. No, this isn't meant for people who are looking for different cinema. Nor is it meant for the viewer who likes movies to appeal to his head. Yet, for those who celebrate and serenade the 'silliness' of mainstream masala movie lore and swear by its popcorn quotient, Dabangg is the greatest getaway of the season.  movie  Debutant director Abhinav Kashyap chooses to walk the road that makes a complete U-turn from brother Anurag Kashyap's edgy, hard-hitting, realistic cinema and opts for a signature tune that re-invents the age-old formula in aaj ka idiom. Plot-wise, the film might make you cringe with it's hackneyed tale of two squabbling step brothers who have the arduous task of keeping the great Indian family together. And guess who's making life even more difficult for the parivaar? Who else but the local goon (Sonu Sood) who tries to play one brother (Arbaaz Khan) against the other (Salman Khan).  But all this brouhaha about a non-story is truly irrelevant, because there never was supposed to be a story in Dabangg. The only factor that was supposed to be there was Salman Khan, Salman Khan, Salman Khan...followed by some more Salman Khan. So just sit back and savour the star power of an actor who chooses to enunciate the role of a thoroughbred entertainer. Salman's corrupt cop act as Chulbul Pandey, playing Robin Hood in a semi-rustic environment is so engaging, you are willing to forgive and forget everything else. As soon as you begin to realise the film hasn't moved at all in terms of story, bingo! There comes Salman swinging his bare fists around, ducking bullets, spewing mischievous threats and abuses, making eyes at his girlfriend (Sonakshi Sinha), creating chaos in his dysfunctional family and breezily breaking the rules with his brattish ways. And in case you still tend to get a bit restless, there is the Pelvic! Watch him gyrate in sync with all those uproarious tunes and you'll be down to your last coin, having flung all the loose change you have on chartbusters like Munni Badnam Hui....And finally, if you still want more, there's the shirt-ripping sequence, where our desi hulk gets to showcase his sculpted torso without having to unbutton it. It simply tears on its own! Now didn't we tell you Bollywood films have their own undefinable logic....  Dabangg is designed as a vehicle to showcase the star charisma of Salman Khan and the actor literally hits bull's eye. He has a ball on screen and makes sure you join the party too.

Thank God, it's all above board and legal. Producer Karan Johar displays a professionalism (and takes care of the legalese) by crediting the film to its original, Chris Columbus' Stepmom (1998) which won hearts with it's countless-wet-hankies emotional saga of Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts fighting for the supermom title. So much so, that once you know that, you don't actually mind the fact that the film is a scene by scene lift of the original, with the actors and the film maker choosing to add nothing more to it.  movie  Herein lies the chink... Wish there was that something 'Extra' to look forward to in We Are Family, specially when the film boasts of two of the most suitable contenders -- Kajol and Kareena -- for the emotional tug of war that spunky Susan Sarandon and svelte Julia Roberts unleashed on screen not so long ago. With two such fine desi actors re-interpreting the cult roles, there was immense scope for originality, chemistry and fireworks. Of course, the two do keep flashing their light eyes at each other and exchanging barbed words when the individual territories are intruded upon. But the fire doesn't burn the screen and the smoke just doesn't hit your eyes.  Also, there is an overriding sense of grief and sobriety that haunts the proceedings, as the family grapples with the threat of tragedy looming round the corner. Unlike Stepmom, which had a lightness of being, despite the impending doom, We Are Family merely has the Jailhouse Rock (Kajol rocks in this sequence) rendition to boast of as dramatic relief, unless you count the noodle war and the water hose splash (cliched!) as family fun and games. End result? You end up squeezing a lot of wet tissues -- specially in the second half -- by the time the movie ends and walk out with a leaden heart.  The film mostly works in the performance department. While Kajol displays her usual charisma, lighting up the screen with an incandescent portrayal of a housewife heroine, Kareena displays a newfound maturity as the glamorous fashion designer who must do the tightrope from carefree girlfriend to responsible mom. She does it well. Arjun Rampal is his usual blend of eye candy and efficient bystander, while teenager Aalia walks away as the eyeball-grabber amongst the kids. Sadly, Shankar-Ehsan-Loy's music score leaves you cold with nothing memorable to carry home, except the Jailhouse Rock ode to Elvis.  Watch it for the all-woman show.

It's a familiar landscape of downtown Mumbai, spilling over with crumbling and crowded chawls with shared latrines, shared aalo paranthas, shared highs and lows and shared commutes in the Mumbai locals as the tenement dwellers set on their daily grind, minus complaints. Yes, there is a joyousness that makes up for this plaster-peeling, non-luxurious landscape as protagonist Madholal celebrates the small pleasures of life with his and family and friends.  The film essentially explores the effects of a terror attack on the common man who survives through it. And yes, it does it effectively. Madholal does manage to come out of the bomb explosion alive and injured, but the scars are more than superficial. The blast leaves his entire psyche bruised, transforming the ever-smiling, over-friendly Madho into a scared, scurrying, suspicious introvert who loses his ability to connect with friends, family and neighbours. Madho's attempts to get back into the mainstream (read Mumbai locals) do have a heroic/humanist tenor to them, just as his family -- wife and two daughters -- creates a warm and vibrant picture of unflinching support and hope.  A brave little film about the small and brave Mumbaikar, Madholal Keep Walking is goodwill hunting in gloomy times.

Can't say, because And Once Again is as enigmatic as its title. Despite its stellar cast, the film doesn't actually engage you because there is neither drama nor mystery in the story of a man who his trying to battle the demons of his tragic past.

Then again, the scared and insecure wife act by Rituparno, fearful of losing her husband to his ex-wife, doesn't ring true.

Once again, he interprets One-Shot Nandu, the blindfold boxer who fells his opponent with a single shot and works for gangster Usman Ali (Piyush Mishra), with characteristic elan. Never hysterical and suitably restrained, Neil's Nandu is the dormant volcano kinda tapori who may be an invincible fighter but desperately fights shy of all emotions. Deepika Padukone's Pinky too manages to touch your heart with her starry ambitions and her raw courage, although Deepika does pitch the emotional quotient somewhat low in an attempt to create a realistic Maharashtrian mulgi, unlike Priyanka Chopra's Sweety, the siren in Kaminey. Together, the duo manage to create a sweet love story with some unusual encounters like watching a movie together, learning to skate-dance together, getting moony on a train top.  Equally arresting is the eminently watchable Piyush Mishra who always manages to add a maniacal zeal to his portrayals. Sadly, his character remains some what undeveloped in the film and the viewer ends up wishing he had more to do.  Add to this, a lyrical music score by R Anandh, with lilting numbers like Man Lafanga and Nain Parindey and some dazzling choreography on rollerskates by Bosco-Caesar, and you have a film that makes up for pleasant viewing. A little more verve however would have gone a long way in energising the show.

Really bored. And you wouldn't blame him for it. For the poor soul is saddled with a sad script that has nothing exciting to offer in terms of characterisation and drama. All that it demands from him is to stand by and watch wife Mugdha Godse go into paroxysms or vacantly stare at nothing in particular, when the possession takes over. Small wonder then, he mostly seems to sleepwalk or desperately tries to keep a straight face while trying to cope with ghosts who walk, creep and crawl across the ceiling. In between, he does some serious talk with the psychic Shreyas who takes one look at his wife and tells him she needs help.  Meanwhile, wife Mugdha Godse tries to bring alive all the sundry posters of Hollywood horror flicks you may have recently seen. With the ghost of her dead twin sister tormenting her, she tries to pull either a Grudge or a Ring with her dishevelled, scary eye look. This, when she's not doubting the fidelity of her husband and suspecting him of having an affair with his leading lady.  Does the horror angle work? Only intermittently, when you sit up and take note of the paranormal proceedings. For the rest of the film, you are mostly counting the minutes.  Please, please, please, will someone give us the real scary movie in desi cinema. It's high time, no?

Kudos to the two of them to carry forth a film which once again doesn't really have anything to boast about in the 'storys' department.  movie  Thematically, I Hate Luv Storys, is extremely simplistic, uni-layered and terribly predictable.

And the fact that it is dealt with a degree of understatement and maturity, with a great music score (Ustad Shujat Hussain Khan and Sharang Dev) to translate the emotional quotient on to the screen, makes it a decent watch. Of course, we would have liked a bit more passion to flow between the protagonists, Mr Mehta and Mrs Singh (Prashant and Aruna) and have definitely liked Mrs Singh to stop falling asleep so often in Mr Mehta's studio, but we are willing to forgive her this accentuated listlessness too. Why? Because when she's not sobbing or sleeping, she's playing a passable wife interrupted, wondering how to cope with her `victim' status, without losing her self-esteem.  But the more interesting -- and complicated -- character is Mr Mehta. An artist by profession, he spends most of his time dabbling with colours in his desolate studio, splashing oodles of paint on his finished and unfinished paintings. Creating and destroying, all at the same time. And when he's not doing this, he's going on long, lonely drives across verdant landscape in search of a muse. Needless to say, he finds the muse back in his studio and it doesn't take long before he is painting piquant nudes of Mrs Singh who also gradually begins to enjoy her naughty dalliance with this rare kinda suitor who is willing to paint her nails, when he's not painting her. The duo begin as the victimised twosome, but soon the lines begin to interestingly blur. Who exactly is the fall guy -- and girl -- in this complicated foursome? More importantly, who is cheating and who is being cheated upon in this film which actually isn't about Mr Singh and Mrs Mehta. It's about Mrs Singh and Mr Mehta who play the game of infidelity with a degree of artistry and subterfuge, adding some strange twists and turns to what would otherwise have ended up as a predictable tale about dangerous liaisons.  Don't go asking for too much and you won't end up disappointed. All the four actors pitch in comfortably, creating characters that are credible and watchable. Aruna Shields, in her second outing after Prince, does display her slim and trim proportions with verve and spontaneity. Sadly, they end up pixelated most of the time, thereby creating an illusion of a Censor Board that has supposedly matured. Prashant Narayanan displays his characteristic control while portraying the maverick painter who lives on another realm altogether, unsure whether to love or hate his wife, despite her infidelity. The high point of the film is its audio track which boasts of some fine ghazals that add a lilt to the proceedings which sometimes do veer dangerously close to the listless. Also, the ambiguity of the relationships is teasing....  The film is a refreshing walk off the beaten Bollywood track and scores on its minimalist approach to matrimonial discord.

Of late, Hindi cinema had been floundering in a plotless marshland, where you either had to merely laugh at madcap situational goof-ups, which were mostly unfunny, or gawk at action cuts, loosely strung by a paper-thin one-liner posing as the plot. By and large -- exceptions notwithstanding -- the good, old-fashioned 'kahani' had gone missing in mainstream lore. Raajneeti marks the return of twist-and-turn drama to contemporary cinema, which indeed is a refreshing turn of events. The film basically anchors its plot in two classic tales -- The Mahabharata and The Godfather -- to create an engrossing diatribe on India's political system where democracy may prevail, but not in its purest form.

He manages to get a lot of film makers who are willing to weave films around him, which isn't what many comedians or character actors can dream of in Bollywood. Sometimes he manages to carry them off (Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, Main Meri Patni aur Woh) and sometimes he slips. Here, he just manages to maintain some ground beneath his slippery feet. But only some.  Set in a sleepy village, the film follows the travails of the postmaster (Rajpal Yadav) as he tries to woo wrestler Sharat Saxena's daughter. Needless to say, he keeps getting into sticky situations but none is as bothersome as the climactic one where he must defeat the mighty Khali before he can claim the village belle's hand. He does try to learn a few tricks of the trade from Om Puri who runs his own akhada, but eventually, it's his me-just-a-joker act which creates a bigger bang than all his thigh thumping in the arena.  Needless to say, the high point of the film is Khali's presence in the film. But this one would be quite a disappointment for Khali fans, because the professional wrestler has a minuscule cameo that includes a terrible sequence where he is supposed to savour an item number too. Poor Khali, he simply can't handle this khal-bali and looks truly uncomfortable.

Digressing from his usual dhamaal comedies, which haven't been quite so uproarious of late, he takes time out to make a desi version of the much felicitated Iranian film, Children of Heaven.  Does he manage to capture the warmth and poignancy of Majid Majidi's 1997 classic? Well, partially. For Bumm Bumm Bole is quite a watchable film, both for adults and kids, with an exquisite canvas where the tea gardens of Ooty double up as the ULFA-infested terrain of Assam. It creates a heartening picture of a destitute family that may be depleted of rations but does have an abundance of love. Dad Atul Kulkarni tries his best to keep the fires burning in his ramshackled home; mum Rituparno feeds her two kids with whatever she can lay her hands on; and the two kids -- Darsheel and little Ziyah -- spend most of their time with school, homework and housework, with almost no time to play, as Darsheel must assist dad and Ziyah must pitch in with mum. But nothing's amiss and no one's complaining, even as the terrorists are creating mayhem in the outside world, for the family knows it's going to be fine as long as they stick together.

It's actually hard to fathom what Sukhwinder hopes to gain with this film. Stardom? Not happening. Sending out some messages on bhai-chara? Not happening.

Ok, so this one's another of those sundry lifts from Hollywood films, repackaged as desi kitsch. But what's there to complain about? Don't we see it happening so often? So let's just try to see if Apartment deserves a dekko or not.  It does. Primarily because of Neetu Chandra. The Garam Masala girl is sure emerging as a fine actor after a dispensable debut act as a routine song-dance dish. After her Traffic-stopping act, came Oye Lucky...Not forgetting her cameo in Rann which managed to standout despite the fact she had to remain a silent bystander for most of the film. Here, in Apartment she ends up as the mainstay, as she plays the edgy, unpredictable tenant, Neha who not only enters Tanushree Dutta's apartment but tries to take up her entire life. Blame it on her orphanage upbringing, but this limpid-eyed girl with the disarming smile is actually a hell cat who doesn't blink before unleashing her venom. And suddenly, when you think she needs handcuffs, she turns into the vulnerable waif all over again. Don't really know what to do with her, do we, except pay attention to her antics that transform this run-of-the-mill thriller into watchable fare. Quite a bravura act indeed, specially since she gets little help from a poker-faced Tanushree Dutta and a routine-act Rohit Roy. Even Anupam Kher spends most of his screen time with his pet cat....

Fleeing from the vile vulture, Dhamki, who smacks his lips while getting any culprits immediately de-feathered, the couple seeks refuge and anonymity in cosmopolitan Mumbai, where they build a house that demands a rent of 50 worms.

Phoonk 2 doggedly follows the formula of Indian horror films. The family enters a strange new house full of dimly lit, unfamiliar corners. They begin to get the chills and feel a creepy presence in the house, specially when they bring in an ugly doll. It isn't long before a black-faced bhoot begins to play peek-a-boo with the sundry family members and threatens them in a husky voice. Sometimes, she even hangs upside down, to increase the scare level. And before you become downright rude and yawn loudly, the director thinks it's time to bring in the kill. One by one, the people begin to die...heads fly off, limbs get severed, skimpily-clad girls drown and maids are butchered. Enter the tantrik and his mumbo-jumbo, which too doesn't work. For the ghost is a diehard one who has already been destroyed by jaadu in part one. Remember?  So, what's really new? Neither the heebie-jeebies nor the storyline. For those who haven't seen Phoonk 1, there's an added problem. You really don't know who Madhu is and why is she baying for Sudeep and his family's blood. A stray reference here and there doesn't actually put the revenge tale in perspective.  Yet, to be fair, the sequel is better than the first film, where all the horror was encapsulated in the caw of a raven. Honestly, who can be scared of a crow? This time, the raven does have a fleeting presence, but the goosebumps are embodied in a full-bodied ghost that makes you jump, maybe once. For the rest, Phoonk 2 really has no cold shivers to boast about. Sudeep tries hard, but doesn't live up to his intense performance in Rann. The music (Subir Kumar Das) is loud and the camera angles (Chandrakant Meher, Charles Meher) are predictable.  Phoonk 2 is just another run-of-the-mill horror film and doesn't do anything to lift the genre to another level altogether. Still awaiting India's classic horror flick. Any desi Hitchcock out there?

Yet it works because it is intensely topical and has an uncluttered charm to it. Set in the precincts of an old world school, it traces the battle of a handful of sincere and committed teachers and students against a newage management that wants to transform the centre of education into a commercial venture. Needless to say, the malaise within Saraswati Vidya Mandir is symptomatic of the disturbing trend which seems to have overtaken our real-life schooling system too. One where an increasing number of private schools are yelling `show me the money' to a growing band of concerned parents. Again, can't blame them entirely, can we? Blame the competition....  But Paathshaala does strike a chord with its simple tale of how a few good men -- and kids -- first try to cope up with a rapidly changing system of education which has the kids trying to hard sell their school by participating in reality shows and grabbing space in the print and television media. The management has not only hiked the fee and is implementing any and every scheme to make an easy buck, it has also hired a marketing company to create a buzz about the school. It doesn't take long before the sensitive and guru-like teachers are all side-lined by the cell-phone wielding image-makers who wouldn't care less about a kid's emotions. But, there's only this much moolah-alone-matters mantra that our in-house Sidney Poitier (read Shahid Kapoor) can handle. Soon, he's spearheading an andolan against the brutish management, along with the bachcha log and the noble profession people.  The film does slog somewhat, specially in the second half and tends to lose momentum due to a loose script and an unimaginative screenplay. Shahid Kapoor underplays his underwritten role as does Nana Patekar. Also, surprisingly there is a non-existent romantic track between Shahid and nutritionist Ayesha Takia. But the emotional quotient and the topicality of the film keep the interest running.  Go for some serious viewing.

They forgot to hire a story writer for it! So, what you end up with are endless action set pieces, interspersed with a few repetitive soliloquies by sundry people on a stolen coin and a micro chip that is the cause of all the jumping, leaping and running around. Why? Because they can enable the possessor to dominate the world. How? Dunno why....  movie  To be fair, the stunts and the action (Allan Amin) is actually well crafted and have a Hollywood feel to them. Vivek Oberoi's death-defying leaps seem credible enough, even as his attempt to play Spiderman and hook up to any and every moving object isn't artificial at all. But hey, how much adrenalin can you pump in a two hour film. Somewhere, you do need to let the testosterone levels drop and strike an emotional chord with your viewers. Or else, they end up with just a cold salad followed by no main course.  And that seems to be the problem with Prince. After a meticulous heist, followed by a memory loss, Vivek Oberoi simply keeps running from a bunch of gangsters and the sleuths of some Indian government agency, headed by Sanjay Kapoor. Somebody extracts his memory even further and declares he's going to die in a few hours unless he returns the coin. Or is it the chip? Maybe it's the coin. But the coin is in his shoe. Or is it in the post office? So what's he looking for in the phone booth? And what's this talk of Mandela being Gandhi? Also, why are three babes telling him different stories? And then, who's the second bad guy who emerges suddenly?  Too many questions taking their toll on the chip packet in your hands. It ain't crunchy anymore, unless you are strictly an action buff who can rest content with Vivek Oberoi repeatedly yelling, \"It's showtime!\" before kicking ass, time and again. Thoda story mangta!

Jaideep Varma not only creates India's first rocumentary, he ends up painting a warm and intense close-up of a creative foursome that not only creates some fine music; it lives it too. For, if you have you have been an aficionado of Indian Ocean's brand of music, you will end up cheering their lifestyle too. Primarily because it encapsulates the entire journey of an artist -- from struggle to success -- and salutes a credo that celebrates creativity and nothing else. The most enlightening moment of the film lies in a confession, when a member tells you there are no leaders in the group and there are no lead artists. We are all basically good accompanying artists who end up great when we play together, says drummer boy Amit Kilam.  And herein lies the beauty of the film -- and the group -- as it captures the individual stories of the perfectly synchronised foursome, even as they jam together in the picturesque, plaster-peeling 100-year-old building in Karol Bagh that serves as their jam pad and their temple of creativity. The passion of Asheem Chakravorty, percussionist, the bohemianism and activism of Raghu Ram, vocalist, the frenzy of Susmit Sen, as he creates a whole new sound through his guitar and the sensitivity of Amit Kilam, the drummer who is essentially a guitarist at heart"},{"Name":"Tum Milo Toh Sahi","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Nana Patekar, Dimple Kapadia, Suneil Shetty, Vidya Malvade, Rehan Khan, Anjana Sukhani","Director":"Kabir Sadanand","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 15 minutes","Review":" Where have you been, Nana? And why don't we see more of you, Dimple? These are the two questions that primarily stare you in the face as you sit through Tum Milo Toh Sahi, a sweet little ode to the spirit of the quintessential Mumbaikar who manages to connect, communicate and build lasting bonds in the milling crowds. The two veteran actors create such a warm picture of humaneness, warmth and togetherness, it leaves you asking for more. And the fact that they are total opposites -- he's Subbu, the reclusive, angry, Tamilian and she's Delshad, the delightful, exuberant Parsi -- makes the bonding crackle and shine some more.  Ever since their first meeting which begins with a fight in a mall, the duo take you by the scruff of your collar and make you sit up and watch them as they chart out a friendship graph that weaves through unchartered territory. Like, Nana playing the violin in his dead mother's room, while Dimple watches or Dimple trying to convince him to open up his house, and himself too, to let in some fresh air. Eventually, Nana does play crusader and try and save her cafe from the land sharks, but it is the smaller nuances and the several unsaids between the adult couple which makes for compelling viewing.  The other actors too manage to create some firmly-etched cameos. There's Suneil Shetty and Vidya Malvade, the discord-ridden couple who are on the verge of a split. And there are the mass communication students, Rehan Khan and Anjana Sukhani, who may or may not transform their fuchha-senior relationship into something more. Bringing them all together is Dimple's corner house cafe, with its bun-muska, its caramel custard and its `We are the world-We are the children' spirit.  Director Kabir Sadanand picks up a simple story and tells it well. And as he does, he touches upon the new trend of the common-man-as-crusader which seems to have taken India by storm currently. More importantly, he captures the 'melting pot' syndrome of our very own maximum city with a treacly tenor that does spread some sweetness in the harsh political reality. A bit of editing needed, however, for the film does tend to ramble a bit, specially in the song and dance sequences. Nevertheless, there's enough to hold your attention. Watch it for the veterans' winsome act, the spirit of Mumbai and for a tale told well.

Salman Khan tries too hard to add some humour to this humourless film. But nothing seems to work. Neither the apology of a plot that tries to preserve the sanctity of marriage amidst extra-marital flings. Nor the plethora of comic actors, headed by Johnny Lever, who ironically make you cringe with their loud, crude, no-laughing-matter acts.  Try figuring out what the filmmaker means when he likens marriage to a public toilet and wives to an internet virus. Maybe Tara Sharma and newcomer Madhuri Bhattarcharya might be able to shed some light on the similes, as they try and keep pace with Arbaaz Khan's wooden antics.  Confused. Unimaginative. Avoidable.

It fails to define itself. Is it a comedy, a love story or a supernatural drama? Does it have a point to make, other than entertain?  The first question raises its head because the plot and the tenor of the film ramble too much. Rarely funny, mostly sentimental, the film seems to waste away its comic potential for some drama that doesn't quite engage. While the encounters with the ghosts, headed by Boman Irani, begin in a lighter vein, they suddenly seem to enter touch-feely territory, with Arshad Warsi, the guy who can see dead people, shedding copious tears while bringing together sons and fathers, sons and mothers, husbands and wives. Case in point"},{"Name":"Mittal Vs Mittal","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Rohit Roy, Rituparna Sengupta, Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, Gulshan Grover","Director":"Karan Razdan","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 15 minutes","Review":" A purposeful film that ends up as pulp, Karan Razdan's take on domestic violence is too long drawn and too verbose, with almost unending courtroom sequences, to keep you engaged. Also, the violence hardly comes through, even though Rituparna, the wronged wife, sheds endless tears while narrating her tale of woe.  Having spurned rich boyfriend, Rohit Roy when he makes an indecent proposal before marriage, middle class Rituparna marries him only because he convinces her of his good intentions. Turns out, the intentions weren't good at all, as she suspected all along. The playboy turns out to be a fiend in bed and seems to have married her mostly for revenge. Needless to say, there's a bad mom-in-law (Dolly Thakore) and her henpecked husband (Amar Talwar) hovering in the background too. The newly-wed does try to take on the sundry forces but when she can't summon any more courage, she simply walks out, hires a lawyer (Suchitra Krishnamoorthi) and joins the dukhi naari brigade. Her job? Mostly, to sit silently through the prolonged proceedings, with tear-rimmed eyes, while lawyer (Suchitra) versus lawyer (Gulshan Grover).  Well-intentioned, yes, but too straight, too talkative and too flag-waving, Mittal versus Mittal is more for the sundry committees on women atrocities than for the new age viewer.

Yes, today, when the industry is throwing up another whole new wave of experimental cinema, Shyam Benegal's Well Done Abba emerges as some kind of a benchmark for our current brat pack who want to say so much, so very differently. The film unfolds like a gentle symphony -- never over the top, never hysterical -- even as it ends up as a hard-hitting satire on the entire misnomer of `India Shining', India growing, India evolving, et al.  Benegal's script takes on the entire government machinery -- politicians, engineers, bureaucrats, cops -- for the malaise that seems to be eating away the system. One which precludes the percolation effects of progress and development into the Indian heartland. Driver Arman Ali (Boman Irani) returns to his village, ostensibly to find a groom for his spunky daughter, Muskaan (Minissha Lamba). But to his dismay, the village is in a state of disarray and destitution. The villagers still have to walk miles to get their water and are forced to even refuse a glass of water to the thirsty and weary. What's more, Arman's twin brother, Rehman (Boman, again) and his begum (Ila Arun) are forced to become fugitives, having stolen water from a protected well. In such a parched landscape, Arman comes across a hoarding which tom-toms a government scheme inviting people to dig wells with official loans. This is the beginning of Arman Ali's tryst with all that's absurd, weird, dishonest and ironic in officialdom, whereby schemes like sundry BPL (below poverty line) benefits and NREGA may exist, but in a state of rigor mortis. The welfare bit of welfare pronouncements rarely reach the real people. After having paid off all the percentages and cuts to the long line of officials, Arman is left with a pittance from the loan. Naturally then, the well exists only on false documents and fake photographs and is even reported as stolen in a bizarre sequence of events... Until, a beleaguered Arman decides to take things in his own hands.  The film is a sheer delight, with the events unfolding in a breezy, comic vein which keeps the ribs relentlessly tickling. But what's more alluring are the colourful characters and the multi-layered approach to the problems of a village which becomes a microcosm of the entire nation. Boman Irani's Arman Ali and Rehman Ali are absolutely awesome, Minissha Lamba's Muskaan is a funky firebrand while Ila Arun's slithery, wily, unscrupulous Salma is a veritable scene stealer. The rest of the ensemble cast pitches in like icing on the cake, with Ravi Kissen and Sonali Kulkarni deserving a special mention as the randy newly weds who are wondering whether a silicone job would add more spark to their nocturnal tumbles. Shantanu Moitra's music creates some unforgettable folksy melodies you walk out humming. But eventually, what remains, is the signature of the maestro, Shyam Benegal, over a canvas delivered with finesse and concern.  Savour and sensitize yourself with substance and soul. Watch some Well Done cinema.  "},{"Name":"Shaapit","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Aditya Narain, Shweta Agarwal, Rahul Dev","Director":"Vikram Bhatt","Genre":"Horror","Duration":"2 hours 22 minutes","Review":" Vikram Bhatt's penchant for the horror film finds another exposition with Shaapit, supposedly the third in the trilogy initiated with the blockbuster Raaz, followed by 1920. This one falls somewhere between the chutzpah of Raaz and the picture-postcard perfection of 1920. It is definitely more gripping than 1920, though it fails to draw you into the drama like the two Raaz sequels. Nevertheless, there's enough to keep the interest running, although we would wish the Indian horror film would somehow extricate itself from mumbo-jumbo, mantra-tantra.  Vikram Bhatt does try to give a more scientific bend to the proceedings by bringing in an erudite professor (Rahul Dev) to unravel the mystery of the ghost who travels through time and prevents the girls from a certain family from entering into wedlock. The Professor helps youngster Aman (Aditya Narain) to find a cure to the curse which plagues his girlfriend (Shweta Agarwal) and sends her into a coma after a chilling tryst with the evil spectre. He takes him on a journey to the distant backwaters and their search ends up in a spooky jail, where the plaster-peeling walls have their own sordid tales to tell. The present day story is basically anchored in two stories from the past and provides ample scope for the film maker to parade kings, princes and scheming queens before the special effects set in.  The film works not so much due to its story. Rather, it's the way Vikram Bhatt tells his story -- with a certain polish and pizzazz -- that draws you in. Also, it's Pravin Bhatt's multi-hued cinematography which adds a lyrical quality to the film. Not much of a debut however for Shweta Agarwal, who spends much of the screen time in comatose, though Aditya Narain is adequate. Watch it, while you wait for our own Paranormal Activity.

Do they have reason to do so? The truth is, Lahore may begin on a note that showcases the Pakistani sportsman (kickboxer, Mukesh Rishi and his coach, Sabyasachi Chakraborty) in a dubious light and has the young Pakistani sports psychologist (Shraddha Das) apologising to our Indian hero on behalf of her entire nation, but it ends on a strong pacifist note and perfectly fits in with the need of the hour. One which demands that the legacy of hate and the baggage of history need to be buried because the principle of an eye for an eye cannot work in international politics.  More importantly, the film does not strike a jingoistic note, despite tracing the entire trajectory of the tumultuous Indo-Pak relationship through the aggressive sport of kickboxing. The tenor of the film is sensitively restrained and low key throughout, with the story of young Virendra's (Aanaahad) journey through grief, acceptance and transcendence unfolding gently through the bone-crunching and jaw-breaking. The cricketer who turns to kickboxing to avenge his brother (Sushant Singh) is helped in his endeavours by the avuncular coach (Farouque Sheikh) of the Indian team. But more than training him in the art of kickboxing, the coach must instil the spirit of true sportsmanship in his player and redefine the concept of patriotism for the firebrand.  Lahore works due to several reasons. Firstly, because of its topicality which strikes the right note in this season when India and Pakistan are seeking a new equilibrium in their relationship. Secondly because of its narrative style which is the antithesis of nationalistic chest-beating Gadar-like films. Lahore tells a fiery story, gently and lyrically and is embellished with some great cinematography (Neelabh Kaul) and action choreography in the kickboxing sequences (Tony Ching Siu Tung). But most of all, it boasts of a stellar act by the performers with Farouque Sheikh walking away with most of your applause as the genteel Hyderabadi who must train a team of winners, despite political and bureaucratic interference.  Lahore is a sensible and gripping film that has you clapping and cheering.

Because hey, here's your chance to savour an intelligent thriller from the desi cinema mills, after a long-long time. Actually, Right Yaa Wrong is neither a mystery nor a thriller. It keeps the viewer in the loop from the word go as it unfolds a murder-gone-wrong drama. Nevertheless, it keeps you at the edge of the seat for most of its engrossing length and breadth. And that's because of quite a few reasons.  First and foremost, the film boasts of an intelligent script which tackles the run-of-the-mill murder and courtroom drama with a teasing twist in the tale. The story runs on two tracks. At one level, there is the domestic drama where cuckolded husband, Sunny Deol, must contend with his physical debility on one hand and his wife's infidelities on the other. And at the other level, there is his friendship with his colleague and buddy cop, Irrfan Khan, which is jeopardised by suspicion, mistrust and questions of moral ambiguity (right or wrong). Irrfan, obviously, is punctiliously wedded to the right and is determined to get after all lawbreakers, even if that entails gunning for his best friend. Add to this, a budding, albeit unsaid, romance between the beleaguered cop, Sunny and Konkona Sen Sharma, Irrfan's lawyer sister, and you have a network of tantalising bonds that keep the tempo running.  But more than the story, it's the performances that add meat to this small little film which comes unnoticed. While Sunny, Isha and Konkona are marvelously restrained, it's Irrfan Khan who walks away with the film -- and your applause -- with his sledgehammer act of the nosey cop who knows something's not right, but can't actually put his finger on the hows of this whodunit. Of course, he knows who did it? But how does he show it to the world, specially when his own sister, Konkona, is determined to prove him wrong....  Wrong marketing for a right film, Right Yaaa Wrong is the surprise package this week. Go, get your thrills.

Debutant director, Rahul Aggarwal has a point to make. He wants to tell a certain Mr Thackeray that all izz well between the quintessential Mumbaikar and the migrant bhaiyya from UP and Bihar. Left to themselves, they can not only live together, despite their cultural and linguistic differences, but might also end up as buddies and brothers....As in the case of Devki Nandan Tripathi (Rahul Aggarwal) who migrates to Mumbai from a distant village on the borders of UP and Bihar and Madan Khachak (Ravi Kissen), the tapori who wears Mumbai on his sleeve and in his heart.  Devki's trip from his village to Mumbai too does have its moments, most of them being created by dad Om Puri, who pitches in a delightful portrayal as Sankhata Prasad Tripathi, the well-to-do North Indian villager, who lives by tradition and swears by custom. What's more, he carries his wealth in the secret pocket in his chhaddis and unabashedly draws it out from the unapproachable vault, whenever needed. Quite funny, specially when he is joined by Paresh Rawal, the typical Mumbai cop, who can barely understand the strange habits of this strange people from such strange villages. But, beyond the rib-tickling moments provided by these two stalwarts, there's not too much to keep the laughs coming. The second half just peters off into cuckoo land, as Devki's newly-wedded wife, Narayani Shastri, ends up in the lock-up and the entire drama is focussed on how to get her out.  Nice message. Amateur attempt. Moments of fun.

Reminiscent of the I Know What You Did Last Summer series, Hide and Seek follows a similar format of chasing a bunch of friends through time, in order to settle a few forgotten scores from the sordid past.  Purab Kohli loves Mrinalini Sharma and wants to gift her a miniature Taj Mahal at a party. But Amruta Patki wants the Taj for herself because she loves the simple boy, while spurning the overtures of Arjan Bajwa, the politician's tapori son. Humiliated by hot-headed Amruta, Arjan is determined to avenge himself with the help of his gutless buddy, Ayaz Khan. And seeing the brewing cauldron at home, Purab's elder brother, Sameer Kochhar, decides it's time to grind his own axe. Envious of his younger sibling's popularity, he tries to twist the events in order to get him out of his way....  Confused? Don't be. The tangled web of relationships does unwind gradually to reveal undercurrents that lead towards death and denouement. And as the odd assortment of friends try to resolve their old differences, Santa Claus comes gunning for them from the dark shadows of the deserted mall. One by one, the group begins to crumble and the mystery peels, layer after layer.  There's enough pizzazz to keep the adrenalin pumping here.

Subtle. And softly funny. Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge is quite unlike the hysterical laugh acts that have been trying terribly hard to make you laugh in recent Bollywood. More of a chuckle-and-a-smirk drama, this one doesn't even try to convince you that life is all ha-ha-he-he. Instead, it creates situations and characters that fill you with warmth and make you smile with the familiar quirkiness of recognisable situations.  movie  Now when was the last time you pulled your hair out when your `unwanted' relatives from Gorakhpur, or any other small town, landed in your pint-sized flat with their pet peeves and infuriating habits. Like gargling before the break of dawn, creating man-made floods in your tiny washroom or converting your favourite window into a make-shift clothesline...Well, that's what our avuncular Chachaji (Paresh Rawal) does when he arrives unannounced at friend Putani's son, Pappu's (Ajay Devgn) house. Pappu's uptown wife (Konkana Sen Sharma) is soon forced to fry pakoras and play hostess to his neighbourhood friends who are naturally drawn irresistibly to this friendly old man who has a grandma's remedy for all their cures and a bhajan for all their woes. It doesn't take long for anger to be replaced by genuine warmth, as Chachaji carries with him a whole culture into the antiseptic flat which had hitherto housed a family that was simply running in a rat race.  Paresh Rawal leads the gentle humour brigade that finds great foot soldiers in the likes of Devgn (restrained and likeable), Konkana (earthy and grounded), Satish Kaushik (watchable) and Sanjay Mishra (impressive).

Irfan Kamal's film on slummy street kids was first screened at the International Film Festival at Goa in 2008. Which means, it was made before Slumdog Millionaire, the film that swept the world with its take on Indian kids who survive and succeed despite the mean streets of Mumbai.  But no, it did not have the backing of Hollywood, the roar of the Oscars, the international marketing blitzkrieg...hence it's relative obscurity and its delay in the release which unfortunately, for no fault of its own, might just give it a has-been feel. But don't let the strange marketing logic of unconventional Indian cinema beguile you, because Thanks Maa is a film that will make you cry and laugh, even as it fills you with admiration and warmth for the next decrepit kid you see on the red light, running nose et al.  What strikes you at the onset is the authenticity of the film. Having used a sterling cast of kids literally drawn from the underbelly of Mumbai, the film anchors their story too in the grime and dust of the megapolis that seems to be brimming over with jagged and broken souls.

And if that's not enough, there's further enticement in the character and currently in-form status of Amitabh Bachchan, who is hell bent on a second, third and fourth coming. After the mesmerising Auro in Paa, Amitabh's eccentric mathematical wizard who talks to Albert Einstein, when he's alone, is immensely watchable in Teen Patti. Of course, there are his musings with Ben Kingsley too. But one would have wished the film makers had made more substantial use of the tumultuous talent of Mr Kingsley than reducing him to a mere listener.  movie  Needless to say, most of Teen Patti unfolds in down market gambling dens as the odd assortment of newbie gamblers -- four students, and a professor, along with Mr Bachchan -- test the theory of probability through the game of cards. But didn't grandmum tell us gambling is addictive. So, before you know, probability is set aside and greed sets in. Along with a bit of blackmail. For even if the professor wants to opt out of this game that's getting dangerous with each passing day, he really can't. Someone's threatening to harm the babalog, if the booty stops coming in the dirty plastic bag that's to be regularly discarded in the bin. But more than all the external threat, it's the insidious changes that are occurring within the group that are a greater cause of alarm. While a young couple aspires to become the next Bonnie and Clyde, greed's corroding some others. Will the days of innocence return? Is crime reversible?  Now these are just a few tantalising queries Teen Patti chooses to address. The second half does get somewhat repetitive, with the film refusing to move out of the gambling dens and the climax gets somewhat hurried. But majorly, the film holds as a taut thriller that keeps you glued for most of the screen time. Watch out for Sunidhi Chauhan's item number, Teri Neeyat Kharab Hai. It rocks.

As Karthik, the cube farm animal (read office nobody) who lives a drab life in a drab house doing drab work, he is absolutely stunning. His anguish at being unnoticed, exploited and squashed by all and sundry -- both in his personal and professional life -- hits you like a sledgehammer. As does his chutzpah, when he metamorphoses into the other, more savvy and socially adept Karthik who may be the nice and safe guy but definitely not the boring guy. Then, it is his quiet confidence and gentle aggression that make you sit up and watch, as he goes about conquering the very worlds that had earlier ignored him. Treat.  movie  But, there's a third avatar too that Farhan showcases with equal felicity. After winning the love of the girl who hadn't even noticed him in the last few years and becoming an equal partner in the success of the company where he works, now that he's forced his khadoos boss to acknowledge his accomplishments, Karthik's life suddenly takes a turn downhill. His mentor, the other, anonymous phone-caller Karthik, gets livid when his identity is revealed and threatens to turn mean. He spoils all his carefully nurtured relationships and sends the poor, derided soul into hiding once again. This time round, the anonymity is even more painful, as KO-ed Karthik tries to put back his life, piece by piece, minus his evil mentor. Does it work?  It does, at one level. Vijay Lalwani's film is immensely watchable, purely for the class act by Farhan Akhtar in the title role. Even Deepika Padukone pitches in perfectly as the sassy, uptown girl who has burnt her fingers a bit too much, as do the fringe players like Ram Kapoor and Shefali Chayya. One does wish there was a bit more of the bubbly Ms Padukone, though. Where it doesn't work is the entertainment factor. The screenplay does tend to get a bit clunky and the drama somewhat heavy as the director looks for text book resolutions of the teasing problem. But, by and large, there is a thrill factor that keeps the momentum on.  In the mood for serious cinema? Watch Karthik Calling Karthik.

But does she really create a scare, this crestfallen, sad little spirit who suddenly begins to peer at him from behind mirrors, under beds, inside closets and sobs tears of blood, wherever she goes? Not really. After a few initial jumps here and there in the beginning, you don't get the heebie-jeebies, simply because the director reveals too much, too fast. Also, the special effects are not quite state-of-the-art and images of the ghost walking upside down on the ceiling or clambering, head downwards, from a ladder, are actually cheesy. They don't chill your bones, as all horror films must do.  The story essentially focuses on a college romance gone awry and the aftermath that follows when spurned Sneha Ullal seeks her pound of flesh from Shreyas Talpade who refuses to get serious after a one-night stand. The chapter summarily ends on a bad note and is re-opened again in the picture-perfect present, when Shreyas has graduated into a hotshot photographer who lives with his model girlfriend, Sada. Driving home on a foggy night, the couple hit a mysterious girl and run. But there ain't no running away from a sordid past"},{"Name":"Toh Baat Pakki","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Tabu, Sharman Joshi, Yuvika Chaudhary, Vatsal Seth","Director":"Kedar Shinde","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":"2 hours 2 minutes","Review":" Tabu returns after a long gap. That should be reason enough to watch Toh Baat Pakki. For she's a fine actor who has proved her mettle, time and again. This time, she opts for a light-hearted comic role in a film that's cast in the mould of the middle-of-the-road comedies that made the eighties' cinema so winsome and breezy. Pitched somewhere between realism and drama, the film somewhat recreates that genteel era when cinema talked about flesh and blood people who didn't scream, holler and howl revenge. More importantly, their concerns were commonplace, like finding a suitable boy/girl and stealing a few romantic moments behind the back of meddlesome mums, didis and dadis. Remember Khoobsoorat, Golmal, Baton Baton Mein and the likes.  Well, Toh Baat Pakki may not be as riveting as the 80s entertainers, yet it rides high on sheer nostalgia. Also, it presents a different kind of cinema in an age that lays great emphasis on high decibel, larger-than-life drama. Tabu's talkative, inquisitive, control freak Rajeshwari who is hell bent on finding the right match for her sister, is eminently watchable. Living in a small town, she seems to have almost perfected the art of the small town conversation, being totally involved in the going-ons in the life of her neighbours and fellow townsmen. On hearing about her neighbour's singleton tenant -- engineering college student, Sharman Joshi -- she immediately lures him to her house and tries to entrap him as a groom for her younger sibling, Yuvika Chaudhary. It doesn't take a lot of effort on her part because the youngsters immediately fall in love. But the love story is short-lived since didi finds another dashing groom, Vatsal Seth, who happens to be Goddess Lakshmi's choice too. Time to throw out the old tenant and bring in the new....  For those who like their films to move at frenetic pace, Toh Baat Pakki may seem a bit laidback. But once you sit back and settle down for some gentle laughs, the film offers you an engaging drama with a tall act by tall and lissome Tabu. Sharman, carries on unspooling his careless charm after his charismatic act in 3 Idiots. A pleasant watch.

It's Khan, from the epiglotis (read deep, inner recesses), not `kaan' from the any-which-way, upper surface. In other words, it's the K-factor -- Karan (Johar) and Khan (Shah Rukh) -- like you've never seen, sampled and savoured before. My Name is Khan is indubitably one of the most meaningful and moving films to be rolled out from the Bollywood mills in recent times. It completely reinvents both the actor and the film maker and creates a new bench mark for the duo who has given India some of the crunchiest popcorn flicks.

A crying family of much-misunderstood Indian patriots wants to be understood. So what does it do? It sends the grand daughter to Pakistan to steal secrets from the evil Pakistani minister, Raza Murad. Now that seems to be kid's play for our comely young thing. For when she's not romancing the minister's son or chopping tomatoes in his kitchen, she's hacking his computer and downloading confidential files with the help of her Indian boyfriend, who, believe it or not, has bribed his way across the border. As if that's not bizarre enough, there's more to this balderdash. Almost all the Pakistanis, other than the ones with mean eyes, wicked grins and skull caps, seem to be hell bent on helping the Indian girl. Aisa bhi hota hai?  Ekdum unbelievable and uncinematic!

And so is Shreyas Talpade. But fine actors need a script, a narrative and a momentum to keep the interest high. The story isn't the problem with The Hangman. It's an interesting tale of a father's ambition to see his son move up in life and not end up like him, pulling the rope over convicts and killers. Sadly, it's a story that loses focus and winds up in incongruous venues, like rave parties and brothels. Enough to get you all fidgety and fussy.  But there is something to watch out for in The Hangman"},{"Name":"Striker","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Siddharth, Ankur Vikal, Vidya Malwade, Aditya Pancholi","Director":"Chandan Arora","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" Okay, so this film does go back in time and picks up a story from Mumbai's dark night that followed the demolition of the Babri mosque on December 6, 1992. Under ordinary circumstances, it might have seemed dated. But today, with the city warding off another divisive and equally dark night that's dangerously looming on the horizon, this time due to the scourge of regionalism, Chandan Arora's Striker, acquires a whole new meaning. Don't divide our city, all you goons, goondas, politicos and administrators, it cries out aloud, through its moving tale of two young lads -- one Hindu, one Muslim -- who try to lead a life of normalcy, despite the shadow of crime and communalism. Childhood buddies, Surya (Siddharth) and Zaid (Ankur Vikal) not only end up toasting the undying bond of friendship, they also salute the spirit of communal harmony, characteristic of their city, through their carefree camaraderie.  But the real hero of the film is Malvani, the ghetto where the two grow up and dream of escape. The director captures the area with artistic detail and an edgy urgency that brings to life another compelling cameo of Mumbai, India's Maximum City. The crummy interiors of the claustrophobic dwellings where families may be low on money, but not on love and the violent alleys where death lurks round the corner in the guise of a naked sword, all coalesce as a perfect backdrop for the young and rebellious Surya to come of age. Although he discovers his skills at carrom at a young age, Surya first tries to find life beyond the grimy, crime-infested carrom clubs that dot Malvani. He wants to get away from the mach-mach (confusion) and make money in not-so-distant Dubai. But when an agent dupes him of his hard-earned money, he's forced to find sustenance in Jaleel's (Aditya Pancholi), the local goonda, carrom clubs where it isn't the striker alone that's at stake. Life's a risky business too, specially since Jaleel wants to take advantage of the communal tension rampant in the city to play his local politics.  Director Chandan Arora has already proved his desire to make different cinema with his earlier two ventures"},{"Name":"Road To Sangam","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Paresh Rawal, Om Puri, Tushar Gandhi","Director":"Amrit Rai","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours ","Review":" The film has done its round at the festival circuit and has garnered appreciable applause. It isn't hard to see why. Because, Road to Sangam is a sensitive plea for secularism and liberalism, even as it shuns the shrill cry of the fundamentalists in any and every religion. More importantly, it articulates the moderate Muslim voice which needs to be heard loud and clear in this cauldron of increasingly hysterical extremist rhetoric. Paresh Rawal's Hashmatullah isn't just a modest car mechanic. He's a walking, talking Preamble of India, upholding the essential values of a sovereign, democratic, secular nation.  The story is simple. Tushar Gandhi, playing himself, wants to transport an urn containing Gandhi's ashes for immersion in the Sangam. But the old Ford he wants to use needs to be overhauled before the procession of Gandhiwadis can make their way on this historic journey. What's more interesting is the juxtaposition of this one-liner plot against the communally sensitive backdrop of the city, Allahabad, which is still simmering after a blast that has caused grave concern amongst the Muslim community. The self-appointed heads of the community have ordered a complete shut-down of their shops and have decided to boycott the event to lodge their protest against the establishment. Mechanic Hashmatullah must not only repair the car's engine under such dire circumstances, he must also teach his community a few lessons in Gandhism, secularism, Indianism. Indeed, an arduous task which he accomplishes with a rare dignity and restraint.  Watch the film for Paresh Rawal's retake on his Mumbai Meri Jaan act. And for its topical message.

Yet, when it comes to drama, it is totally Hollywood. Debutant director Abhishek Chaubey tells his story with a panache that falters only in the end. Ironically, if he hadn't faltered in winding up this delectable little tale of a wicked trio, with nothing to lose not even their morals -- he would have created a masterpiece. But the last few reels are so much of a rumble-tumble, they leave you both confused and somewhat dissatisfied.  movie  But till you reach the slipshod resolution of the story, Ishqiya is pure delight. Both in terms of the narrative that moves from one tangy twist to another; and in terms of the performances, which are so zippy, they fill you with beans. Naseeruddin Shah lives and breathes the role of the wily and somewhat wizened Khalu Jaan who doesn't balk at falling on his would-be assassin's feet, begging for mercy. Nor does he see anything amiss in colouring his beard black, when the wily widow, Krishna (Vidya Balan) sets his testosterone in play with her seductive song and guile. But Arshad Warsi doesn't want to be left behind as Babban, the rustic rogue and matches him crooked step for step. And the duo are totally bindaas as rivals in love, ready to beat each other to pulp for the charms of Krishnaji. As for Krishnaji"},{"Name":"Rann","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"4.0/5","Cast":"Amitabh Bachchan, Riteish Deshmukh, Sudeep, Paresh Rawal","Director":"Ram Gopal Varma","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 15 minutes","Review":" It's gritty. It's grey. And it's greatly topical too. Ram Gopal Varma returns to his let's-dissect-the-real-world brand of cinema with the racy-pacy Rann that might run on predictable lines, nevertheless it makes for a gripping viewing with its behind-the-scenes dekko on the Breaking News, any which way, syndrome that seems to have overtaken certain sections of the media. And, like Satya, Company and Sarkar, which re-visited India's mighty 'n murky underworld through the lens of edgy semi-realism, Rann too rips off the mask of honest reportage from the TRP-obsessed television media that has fallen prey to presenting anything -- mythology, folklore, fantasy and even falsehood -- as news.  movie  Of course, at the onset, we'd like to forewarn you"},{"Name":"Pangaa Gang","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Voice of Archana Puran Singh, Sudesh Bhonsle","Director":"Pankaj Sharma","Genre":"Animation","Duration":"1 hour 30 minutes","Review":" Here's another case of animation gone awry. What could have been a sweet little ode to the environment ends up as a cranky and crude tale of a bunch of kids who team up with the animals to save the forest greens from greedy poachers.  But the treatment is so B-class Bollywood, complete with item numbers, it could balk even the bravest kid -- and parent -- who dares to venture in. What's even more sad, and sorry, is the animation. Completely flat and drab. Now that's ironical, specially since our Indian animators were behind the beautiful Tinker Bell, released recently, and there seems to be an Indian connect with the box-office bending, Avatar too.

For, it does take a whole lot of bravado to pick up a blast from the buried past and present it an age when everyone is determined to tell a brand new story in Bollywood. Of course, films like Lagaan and Jodhaa Akbar did manage to strike a chord with the newbie viewers too, but they were more like exceptions to the rule. By and large, the scheming Brits and their grab-India story has been confined to the creative bin when it comes to modern Indian cinema, song and literature.  movie  Hence the importance of Salman Khan's Veer which celebrates a kind of cinema that might soon be extinct in desi film lore. No one, just no one, would dare to flaunt a hero who claws off 'paanch sair ghost' (five Kgs of flesh) from his opponent's body or pulls out his intestines with utmost glee! This is merely some of the minor dare devilry our Veer indulges in, apart from dancing with a fractured leg, flinging broaches through fast-moving trains, pulling off hands in a handshake and pledging to fob off entire armies with fist and sword alone.  But hey, what can you do with a larger-than-life character when he doesn't have a larger-than-life cause spelled out for him? You simply follow him through his chaotic ramblings as he desperately tries to look for a raison d' etre in the turbulent times (1857). We never really get to know what this brave Pindhari warrior actually wants. Does he want to avenge his daddy's (Mithun Chakraborty) humiliation at the hands of the deceitful king (Jackie Shroff) who duped the warrior tribe of its land? Does he want to put an end to the soul-killing British Raj? Or does he simply want to sing and dance with the pretty princess (Zarine Khan), who also happens to be his enemy's daughter?  Well, you can savour the larger-than-life canvas, for some time at least. Periodically, you can enjoy the lavish expanse of this epic which boasts of some fine cinematography (Gopal Shah) and a string of adrenaline-pumping action sequences (Tinu Verma). You can also sound the mandatory wolf whistles on Salman's unabashed beefcake appeal that spills over in every frame of the film. Intermittently, you can also applaud him for trying his best to create a hero out of this ill-conceived, cardboard cut-out that seems to hobnob between Dharmendra's Dharam Veer and Russel Crowe's Gladiator. But after that, there's nothing left to hold your attention in this prolonged misadventure that loses a lot due to a tardy screenplay, a headless script and an old-fashioned direction.  Guess it's time for a fine actor like Salman Khan too to hop onto the current Indian avant garde bandwagon and do the different (read topical, a typical) samba.

There's the young girl (Radhika Apte), enroute to Pune, who has a discman with dead batteries and a newspaper with horrorfic headlines to fill her hours. She's just read about the serial killer who rapes and hacks his victims, one of whom was found in the vicinity. There's the mysterious young man (Raja Choudhary) who almost matches the description of the killer. His odd behaviour seems to fuel the suspicions, even further. There's the squabbling couple who never let go of their belongings and there's the strange cop too, harassing the passengers with his untimely investigations. But more than all this, there's the imminent danger lurking through every dark cranny of the crummy waiting room. When will the killer strike next? That seems to be the million dollar question hanging heavily through the clouds and the cobwebs that make this the most inhospitable place on earth.  But hey, does the director manage to capitalise on the fear factor and build up a credible thriller that keeps you on tenterhooks? Partially. You do get edgy, here and there as Raja Choudhary does manage to build up the whodunnit with his inexplicable comings and goings. But soon enough, the claustrophobia of the closed interiors and the closed drama begins to set in and the film does begin to seem a bit stretched out. This Waiting Room needed a few more twists and turns to make the tension palpable.

And then, how many times have you seen him eventually rise like the Phoenix over a relentless period of struggle which has him being shunted out of producer's offices, battling with rejection slips, shedding a salty tear of desperation on the salty sea front or giving himself some pep talk when the going gets really tough.  Umpteen times. And that's where Ken Ghosh's film slips. For, it offers you nothing new in terms of the script which ends up as the weakest link in this entire show. Sadly, it follow all the predictable twists and turns that comprise the star-is-born story. Yes, super-talented Sam (Shahid Kapoor) does leave his dad (Parikshat Sahni) to sell saris in saddi Dilli, in order to become an actor in big, bad Bollywood, minus a godfather and a grand daddy. Yes, he bides his time making low brow lungi ads and pitching in as a courier boy, hoping the empty promises of stardom might just come true. And yes, they do come true, but only after a prolonged period of struggle which goes through the usual grind of hunger, a homeless and penniless state.  Yet, what makes this film watchable is the passion that Shahid Kapoor injects in his delineation of Sam, the struggler with stars in his eyes. May be, it's the autobiographical strains of the film -- the advertisements, the dance school, the chorus boy act, the no-godfather syndrome -- that stoke the fire in him. But there is a ring of sincerity and authenticity in his `Hi, I'm Sameer Behl and this is my number, Sir,' stuff during the sundry auditions that seem to be going nowhere. Also, the interactions with the school kids, when he tries to make a living as a dance teacher, has a spontaneity about it. Again, perchance spilling over from his days with Shiamak Davar. The initial I-hate-kids attitude is absolutely delightful -- and refreshing -- too. Add to this the effervescence of Genelia as Tina, the scooty-riding choreographer who thinks from her heart and you have an adequate medley of some moments of fun, fuzz and fantastic moves on the dance floor. Although, we do confess the audio track (Pritam Singh, Adnan Sami, Ken Ghosh, Sandeep Shirodkar) isn't much to boast about, considering the film is actually conceptualised as a musical.  The film may not have the emotional quotient of Ishq Vishq, Shahid and Ken's first film that set the box office on fire, yet it does have its moments. A better scripted, less cliched second half would have surely given the film a better chance to dazzle and shake.

Bollywood -- and all fiction, for that matter -- believes impossible ain't a word when it comes to testing the power of love. Hence, the preponderance of the froggie-turned-into-a-Prince-Charming pyaar in fairy tale and folk lore.  movie  So we aren't really surprised when a hot and happening Priyanka Chopra sweetly declares she ain't no princess, just an ordinary girl and falls in love with Shrek's colonial cousin, Abhay the geek, who's been nurturing a doggy devotion for her for the last seven years. Of course, he does re-enter her life as the nanny to her brattish girl (sassy tween Advika Yadav), washes her dishes, does her laundry and plays friend and counsellor to her when she's drawn towards the office Lothario (Dino Morea).  But that again isn't the A-ha moment in this film. What really surprises us here are the gripping performances and the unrushed restraint with which this run-of-the-mill romance unfolds and manages to gently draw you into the drama. Uday Chopra's nerdish Abhay is almost lovable with his low key, almost unnoticeable presence; Dino Morea is suave yet devilish; young Advika is precocious, yet precious....But hey, it's Priyanka who never does let you blink. As Alisha, the careerist who always falls for the wrong guy and struggles to keep her sundry avtars -- mom, working woman, lonely girl longing for love -- in sync, she's terrific. Truly, in terms of talent, she's one of the most watchable actors currently. Remember Fashion, Dostana, Kaminey.  Of course, in terms of the script, you are reminded of so many Hollywood films you have seen. The most recent being the Catherine-Zeta Jones and Justin Bartha romance, The Rebound, where Bartha's nanny scenes seem to have been summarily fitted into Pyaar Impossible. But eventually, the film scores with a desi feel that is making its presence felt in more and more urbane comedies rolling out of the Bollywood mills.  Nothing stupendous here.

Remember the actor who walked away with your applause as the student leader in Anurag Kashyap's maverick movie Gulal? More importantly, the film provides a role of a lifetime to Celina Jaitley as the nurse who seems to lose all her humaneness in a freak situation. And if that's not enough, it marks another return of the talented Farooque Shaikh to mainstream cinema after the disastrous Saas Bahu aur Sensex.  Sadly, nothing seems to work in its favour. Abhimanyu Singh's drug peddlar act is too minuscule and poorly-crafted to actually make a difference. Farooque Shaikh as the hit-and-run victim spends too many awkward moments lying upside down on screen. And Celina Jaitley simply screams her lungs out or feverishly gulps down whiskey, vodka or what-you-will to display her fear, anger and desperation as the woman who might lose everything -- her future in London, her life with boyfriend Singh -- after some binge drinking.  All set for an interview with the Red Cross, Celina spends the evening partying with friends. But too much Ecstasy and alcohol send her into a tizzy and embroil her in an accident on her way back home. Instead of abiding by the law, the woman panics and drives off into her garage, with the victim (Farooque Shaikh) dangling and desperately begging for help. She tries to wrap up the sordid story with the help of her boyfriend, Abhimanyu Singh, who keeps popping some more pills into her. Naturally, the out-of-focus twosome can hardly control events which completely go out of hand. As does the film.

What's Naseeruddin Shah doing in Bolo Ram. He has such a dispensable role as a two-scene psychiatrist, it's almost a shame. Then again, what's Om Puri doing in Bolo Ram? He has such a poorly-etched routine cop act, he could almost sleepwalk through it. Also, doesn't Padmini Kolhapure deserve a better comeback film than one which relegates her to the status of a corpse after a one-dimensional screaming mom act? After all, she was one of our better actors in her heydey.  The trouble with Bolo Ram is that it boasts of a great cast, then botches it up by focusing too much on a wooden Rishi Bhutani who can barely bring to life the character of the enigmatic, unpredictable son who might have killed his mother in a fit of rage. Ram (Rishi) is essentially supposed to be an overgrown babe who lives on the fringes of sane society.

So, when was the last time you woke up to a grumpy spouse/partner, a splitting head and memory interrupted...All you remember of last night's wild party are stray vignettes of drooling over the dishy stand-out-in-the-crowd, following him/her, whiny dawg-like, and desperately trying your luck with your best pick up lines. Voila! One line seemed to have worked, for the last memory you have is of a remote corner and some rosy possibilities that may or may not have come true. Did they come true....So how do you resolve the mystery of the one-night stand?  Director Saurabh Shukla makes a sassy attempt to tell you how. Yet sadly, the film that begins so smartly -- great characterisations, witty dialogues, funky situation -- peters off into a somewhat pheeka climax, with our protagonists being forced to do an Akshay Kumar (hide in a closet). Now that's unwarranted because Raat Gayi... isn't supposed to be a run-of-the-mill comedy like De Dana Dan, is it? And awkward situations in slice-of-life cinema are generally resolved more realistically.  Nevertheless, the film does augur for interesting viewing, providing an opportunity for a roll call of the entire current art house ensemble cast. Rajat Kapoor and Iravati Harshe are the upmarket couple invited to a party full of stock people. There are the hosts, pseudo-intellectual writer Dilip Tahil and airhead wife Navneet Nishan, the soil-bound Vinay Pathak and his svelte missus, Anuradha Menon, the ekdum desi `Austraylian myte', Ranveer Shorey, the enigmatic artist, Aamir Bashir and the oomph factor, Neha Dhupia. Trouble begins when Rajat Kapoor has a drink too many and can hardly control his libido after spotting the mysterious single woman (Neha Dhupia) who agrees to play hide and seek with him in the overcrowded house. Nothing wrong with that, except that Rajat's a devoted husband and Dhupia's already got a boyfriend. Have the flirty twosome ended up jeopardising their core relationships? Did the one-night stand actually happen? Is Sex and the City more than a mere sitcom?  Watch out for some fine performances by the entire cast. Veterans like Rajat Kapoor, Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey are eminently watchable as always. But it is Neha Dhupia who is fast emerging as the natty new wave girl with her newfound talent. Not forgetting her item numbers too which do set the mercury rising in mainstream masala. Don't go looking for a desi flavour of the screwball comedy, The Hangover and you might just enjoy this slightly heady potion too.

Haven't the makers actually realised that Indian cinema has indeed come a long way since women cried their way through films, divorce was a taboo, mothers didn't re-marry and men wasted away in the shadows.  Ostensibly, Aseema (Gracy Singh) is a strong women. She turns her back to a bad marriage, takes up a job and decides to spend her life bringing up her daughter. Midway her crusade, she falls in love with the friendly neighbourhood doctor (Aseem Merchant) but strangely refuses his proposal with a whole lot of moth-balled talk about `parityag' and `tyag'.

But, mice are nice, scoffs HP, hating his own niceness and mousy inconsequence.  movie  Poor HP. Doesn't he know nice guys always do finish first. Specially in a new world which has cried Yes, we can to a post-Lehman world order; and a new India that has embraced a similar mantra of change in both governance and the level of public tolerance. Indeed, Rocket Singh, scripted brilliantly by Jaideep Sahni, documents the new India we are currently seeing emerging before our eyes. One, where the common man is increasingly voicing his condemnation for both political and corporate corruption. Also, one where the consumer (read aam aadmi) is truly king and vfm (value for money) is the only usp (unique selling proposition).  So, don't be bogged down by the slow pace and the docu-feature feel of the first half of Rocket Singh. Be patient and you'll end up realising this could be well be one of the most intelligent films of the year, showcasing the changing pulse of a nation that is learning to sift the grain from the chaff, the rubble from the concrete, the diamonds from the ashes. The film does take long -- laboriously long -- to introduce its characters and build up the plot which focuses on the travails of an honest-to-god, stars-in-my-eyes salesman who joins a computer firm, only to be taken aback at the first bribe that's demanded of him. Aap mazaq kar rahen hai, (you're joking) he tells the company manager who wants a kickback and files a complaint against him in the suggestions & complaints box. End result? He becomes a mazak in his own company, having been sent to the dog house and given his marching orders at the end of his training period. But there's an important lesson failure Harpreet has learnt from him wily manager, Nitin-with-the-natty-sideburns (excellent act) during is first sales demo. Even Spiderman has to take a risk, and you're just a puny salesman, his smart alec boss tells him as he pockets a fresh contract by hook or by crook.  Hence, it's Spiderman to the rescue....The second half just sky rockets onto another plane as Harpreet sheds a bit of his honesty for some hard-nosed business. No, his business isn't to make money. All he wants to do is avenge his humiliation and tell his boss he isn't a zero, a failure, a fool, a joker sardar...He teams up with the 'item girl' (the intelligent, yet hot, Gauhar Khan), the peon (super), the porn king (D Santosh, brilliant) and forms his own company, offering partnerships to all. Naturally, the company rocks, the sales zoom, the rivals fume and the film crackles with a newfound energy. Because, as we said, HP loses just a bit of goodness, not all. At the core, he still remains the god-fearing, good soul, brought up on his dadaji's (Prem Chopra, also excellent) middle class morals and conducts his business on the basis of the current corporate ethics which put people before numbers, laugh lines (customer satisfaction) before bottomlines. So what's the difference between you and me, his defeated and disjointed boss asks him in the climax speech. You see numbers, I see people, Harpreet explains, before walking off with another promise. See you in the field!  Yup! HP is just another one amongst those few good men who we believe will charter a new course for the world in general. He's a brave little fella who doesn't balk before taking on the high and mighty and is just a wee bit wily -- of course, he plans to pay back all dues at an appropriate time. So that doesn't really make him dishonest. More importantly, he doesn't think a moment before making his peon his partner and ends up stealing your heart with his boy-next-door simplicity and non-heroic charms.  The winning duo of Shimit Amin and Jaideep Sahni may not be offering you a Chak De India this time round, but they do sculpt some rare moments on celluloid that end up redefining the pursuit of happiness as something more than mainu chaida, chaida, chaida! (I want, want, want!) After Ajab Prem ki Ghazab Kahani, Ranbir Kapoor once again proves he's amongst the top GenNow contenders for the Bollywood throne. His delineation of Harpreet Singh Bedi is completely the opposite of Prem"},{"Name":"Paa","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"3.5/5","Cast":"Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Vidya Balan","Director":"R Balki","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 14 minutes","Review":" Auro says a 'Boo' -- and a mighty big one -- to all us skeptics out here who had begun to doubt his ability to entertain after duds like Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, God Tussi Great Ho, Aladin...For, it's not any and every 67-year-old actor who can enter the shoes of a pre-adolescent, without looking and sounding awkward and silly. Amitabh Bachchan not only captures the essence of the gawky, geeky, god-he's-different teenager with great skill, he creates a whole new benchmark for an actor to experiment, innovate ad reinvent himself when the career graph seems to plateau. The actor looks different (almost unrecognisable as E.T.'s country cousin), talks different (with a slight nasal twang), moves different (an awkward shuffle that breaks into the Auro dance) and emotes different (mostly through his be-spectacled eyes). End result? Paa is an experience that works, only because it is so different.  movie  The film opens with a somewhat static and diffused first half that lights up intermittently, when Auro is around. Wonder why it takes so long to come to the point....Having been given an award in school by the young, upcoming, friendly neighbourhood neta (Abhishek Bachchan), Auro sends single mom, Vidya Balan into flashback mode. That's because the neta fathered her child and left her to tackle the unwanted pregnancy because he wanted to change the world. Vidya, the archetypal woman of substance, not only carried her pregnancy through, she lovingly nurtured her child after discovering he had a genetic disorder that was causing him to age prematurely. Between them, Vidya and her mother (impressive Arundhati Naag) built a loving and normal world around the young boy who loved King Kong, computers, mirchi and hated kichdi. Trouble begins when Auro unknowingly befriends his dad and requests him for a visit to Rashtrapati Bhawan. Time for some home truths to be told, confessions to be made, repentance to be done and wrongs to be righted. Before time runs out...  The film, which peters off into vague sub-plots about slum redevelopment and unwarranted media-bashing in the first half, suddenly picks up and scales new heights in the second half. It's here that Auro and his antics prevail as he tries to rebuild his family and establish his bond with his newfound daddy. Almost each and every relationship he shares is imbued with a warm glow"},{"Name":"Radio","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"2.0/5","Cast":"Himesh Reshammiya, Sonal Sehgal, Shenaz Treasurywala","Director":"Ishaan Trivedi","Genre":"Romance","Duration":"1 hour 57 minutes","Review":" Himesh Reshammiya tries to reinvent himself too. And there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, this new clean, casual avtar of his does seem to work better than the earlier showman-nish one, where the hairdo wasn't the only thing out of place. Himesh as Vivan, does seem to have found a better groove. It's just that this time round, it's the generation gap that creates a chasm.  The story that tries to talk about the relationship rigmaroles of the Facebook GenXers doesn't seem to be tailor made for an e-wary Himesh. It just is a bit too young with its FB terminology and its twenty-something heroine (Shenaz Treasurywala) who has a penchant for updating her status on the social network, whenever she's not making eyes at her colleague. So, naturally all this spiel about 'commitment', 'closure' and a 'complicated' relationship status does end up as awkward and odd from someone who would have outgrown FB, Orkut, MySpace years ago.  Also, the story is told in awkward jerks, through Tarantino-ish chapters. Only, unlike Tarantino, these chapters bear weird names about kurkure, kadhi and Paranjabi lassi. But, all said and done, the film has its moments. The radio jockey's attempts to engage with Treasurywala's hybrid Punjabi-Parsi family, headed by Zakir Hussain, does have a lot of fizz. As do some of the romantic tangles between the unlikely threesome of Himesh, his ex-wife, Sonal and his girlfriend, Shenaz. But what works most is the music of the film. The audio track reinforces his expertise, both as a singer and a composer, making you wish the musical was defined in a better way.  Time for the singer-composer-actor to take up something that suits both his age and his newfound style.

He turns producer with Aao Wish Karein. Now that may be a step in the right direction, but the end product doesn't turn out to be a fairy tale debut for the daring actor. And that's because the film fails to decide its core audience. Is it a kiddie's flick or is it meant for the bada log? If so, there's too much of the baba log in the film (the children's track is too long) and too little of the adult stuff (like, how does a 12-turned-21 handle his hormones). This makes the film waddle in no-man's land.  Set in a picturesque hill town, the story tries to unravel the complications in a young boy's life when he grows up overnight into an adult (Aftab Shivdasani) and can actually serenade the woman (Aamna Sharif) he loves. So he sings songs with her, treats her to fries and burgers, gifts her a dinky car, invites her to share his playstation and welcomes her in Spiderman slippers. The girl, simple hill lass, can't tell something's amiss and simply thinks he's cute. She even cajoles him into marriage and waits for him at the altar, veil et al. Will the kid-cum-adult groom oblige?  Now that's a Big question...Obviously inspired by Tom Hanks 1988 classic (Big) that was nominated for two Oscars, the film lacks all the masala that made Penny Marshal's film such a winsome experience. Also, the romance between Aftab and Aamna is quite thanda. Thoda aur wish karein?

And nothing but the real world. The filmmaker who is wedded to reality in terms of cinema, turns his attention from bars girls, page 3 people, traffic lights and fashion grime to the sordid interiors of Indian jails. And once again, he manages to create a hard-hitting canvas peopled with characters who manage to both disturb and touch your heart with their stories of distress. More importantly, the film raises important questions regarding our tardy legal system and calls for a complete redressal, if justice must prevail.  movie  It could have been an ordinary day for upwardly mobile Parag Dixit (Neil Nitin Mukesh) who has just been promoted at his job and is poised on the threshold of a bright future with his girlfriend-for-keeps, Mansi (Mugdha Godse).

Really, Ranbir is a revelation, Katrina is full of beans and the newly formented Ranbir-Katrina chemistry sets the screen on fire in this mad hatter's tea party that takes you on a roller-coaster ride as Raj Kumar Santoshi tries to retrack his way to his Andaz Apna Apna days. The Salman-Aamir comic caper may not have stormed the box office in the 1990s but today, it has devoted fans who don't miss it on its umpteen TV re-runs. Ajab Prem... might not suffer the same fate and may kick up some fun moments in the here and now, rather than the future.  movie  And why not! For not only Ranbir and Katrina, the rest of the cast is in crackling form too. Of course, leading the brat pack is Ranbir's ninth-drop out Prem, the president of the Happy club, who hangs out with all the losers in town, calls a Ferrari a Fawwari and abducts young girls to send them packing to their boyfriends, for a living. He falls in love with Jenny (Katrina Kaif), the prettiest newbie in town, who's smart, sassy, orphaned and in need of a friend. And yes, she's also a vegan, with a penchant for pudine ki chutney with moong dal pakodas. But that's a home truth our hero takes time to learn, along with another fact of life that makes it difficult for him to cross the thin line between best buddy and boy friend. But the Ranbir-Katrina dosti draws its flavour from the other characters too. Like, Ranbir's adorable mum-dad (Smita Jaykar-Darshan Zariwala) who love him any which way and the local don Sajid (Zakir Husain) who has neither a functional cell phone nor a loaded gun. All he has is hot air. The plot progresses like a jolly ride into cuckoo land as Ranbir tries to bring Katrina's love story to a logical end. Of course, he does manage to succeed, despite his bumbling ways and ends up stealing the show with his crazy antics, his witty one-liners and his comic sense of timing.

But truly, we fail to get the point because the film doesn't work at any level. Neither do the genie (Amitabh Bachchan) and the Ring Master (Sanjay Dutt) create magic with their over the top acts, nor does the Riteish-Jacqueline romance strike a chord. In fact, for the two veterans, Amitabh and Sanjay Dutt, this might be one their most bizarre performances. If Amitabh suffers a bad hair day with his unbecoming wigs and is sartorially challenged throughout the film with his sequined jackets, red waistcoats and white sneakers, then Dutt ends up as a shabby blend of Heath Ledger's Joker and his own Khalnayak. Riteish, meanwhile, shuffles through the film with a hangdog expression, woozy and woolly-headed for most of his I'm-the-archetypal-loser act.

His antics, like the animation, falls flat and the film fails to establish itself as entertainment ammunition for newage kids.  So much so, the film maker too realises he's gone too heavy and asks the youngsters to take a break with an out-of-sync break dance performed by a bunch of shabby rats. They are the narrators of the story which tries to throw light on the bond between Ganesh and his carrier rat, who happens to be a tamed rakshas.  The mythological largely works in episodic form, showcasing Ganesh's skills at penning down the lengthy Mahabharata with his tusk and then single-handedly taming the rakshas who threatened mayhem in deity land. Really, the narrative is too heavy-handed to strike a chord with PSP kids nor does the animation promise to find favour with the playstation generation.  Adults, are you game for Gannu's antics?

After an unfruitful watch, you feel completely let down since the film boasts of a star cast that includes most of the contemporary funsters of the entertainment industry.  Kunal Vijaykar's humour has been creating quite a few irreverent and extremely watchable in laughs in the weekly news that wasn't show anchored by Cyrus Broacha. So you naturally go in expecting some modern gigs that would not only tickle your funny bone but would also stand apart from the archetypal leave-your-brains-behind contemporary Bollywood comedy. Doesn't work. All you end up with is barely two laughs and a chuckle as bumbling loser, Jolly Maker (Cyrus Broacha) tries to save his disinterested love interest, Monica Gokhale (Dia Mirza) from a bunch of kidnappers. The kidnappers work for the mad Maharajah Holkar (Boman Irani) who wants to bomb the Mumbai Mantralaya, to gain control over his 18th century palace which lies buried beneath the gutters of the building. The Maharajah, who loves to surround himself with geriatrics, works in tandem with corrupt builder Khandar (Mahesh Manjrekar) who in turn, employs a weird scientist (Rajit Kapoor) to build a bomb for the mission.  Needless to say, every character has a qualifying craziness. If Cyrus unintentionally spells trouble for everyone with his low IQ, then Manjrekar tries his best to create mayhem with his nonsensical vocabulary, generously sprinkled with words like Dustin Hoffman, Inzaman-ul Haq, Osama Bin Laden, George Bush as verbs and adjectives. They mean nothing and make for no laughs after the initial fun is over. Boman, on his part, plays it completely over the top with his persistent `nashta kiya' query to any and everyone. What's the joke, anyway? As for Dia Mirza, it's time to reprise Lady Lara Croft once again, after Acid Factory. This time, she's a RAW agent on a save-Mumbai mission, losing her heart midway to the loser Cyrus.

Infact Kaante was a tryst with Reservoir Dogs for the desi film buff.

There is a similar gritty feel to the drama that threatens to explode at every twist and turn. Sadly, it never does, specially in the first half. And herein lies the problem with Acid Factory which scores so much in style but falls somewhat short on drama.

Director Anurag Singh neither manages to create an appealing romantic social nor a sincere sporty movie.  The movie fails to build any sort of dramatic tension that Lagaan built in the climax. Perhaps Singh should have watched a few more T20 games. You don't chase 213 after reeling at 47 for 9 in 10 overs. There's a limit to willing suspension of disbelief. Worse, the unappetising songs interrupt the narrative's flow.  The movie has its moments though. The actors too try hard. DBH was meant to be a comeback vehicle for Rani Mukherjee. The movie offers her ample opportunities to showboat her acting range. Comedy, drama, dancing - she gets to do it all. Ms Mukherjee acts with the same abandon that endeared her to millions. But, at times, she appears too eager to impress. Kapoor is restrained but impressive. As an oomph girl, Sherlyn Chopra grabs attention. Who wouldn't in hot pants with accessories dangling from the bellybutton?

And Mahesh Manjrekar is a scene-stealer as the crooked cop.  In the recent past, Bollywood's action heroes seemed to have lost faith in the genre they once excelled in. Guys like Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgun abandoned their fists of fury and reinvented themselves as lover boys and comics. Other men of meat and muscle, Sunny Deol for instance, went out of the frame because they couldn't adjust to the changing public tastes.  But late last year, the winds of change could be felt as six-pack Aamir Khan's violent Ghajini became a blockbuster. Now with Wanted, the knuckle-crushing action flick roars back in an improved avtaar. In Bollywood, men are back.

But ever since Rajit Kapoor acted as the bhadralok sleuth, Byomkesh Bakshi, in a Doordarshan television serial directed by Basu Chatterjee in the 1990s, he seems born to solve murder mysteries.  In the pretentiously titled Blue Oranges, Kapoor again plays an investigator who probes the killing of an attractive woman. He must investigate a bunch of suspects -- ex-lover (Aham Sharma in a polished performance), tenant's son, a rich-brat who gave her a lift and the police commissioner's own brother (Harsh Chhaya) who had befriended her -- before arriving at the startling truth. It is Kapoor's presence -- intelligent and dignified - that makes the whodunit much more watchable than it actually is. The story may be original but the killer's identity reminds you of a famous Agatha Christie novel.  Blue Oranges is painstakingly crafted but too dour and too clinical for its own good. It is all mind and no heart. The progression of the case causes no corresponding rise in the viewer's heartbeat or curiosity level. Bereft of humour, pace and drama, the movie takes on a drab, monotonous tone. If it were a television serial, one would have been tempted to switch channels.  Back in the 1960s, Hindi films offered a different kind of suspense thrillers. The plots were often borrowed from Hollywood hits or popular firang crime bestsellers. But the final outcome was pure masala Bollywood. Remember Gumnaam or Bees Saal Baad? And how they weaved in songs and dance with riveting suspense? Well, times have changed. And a more focused style of storytelling has taken over. Unfortunately, as Blue Oranges shows, the final result isn't necessarily better or more absorbing cinema."},{"Name":"Vaada Raha","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"1.5/5","Cast":"Bobby Deol, Kangana Ranaut, Dwij Yadav, Atul Agnihotri","Director":"Sameer Karnik","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"2 hours 5 minutes","Review":" The best thing about Vaada Raha is that Bobby Deol remains paralysed from neck down almost right through the film.  The second best thing is that while Kangana Ranaut may not have had botox injected into her thin lips, she may have attempted a silicon filling. The worst thing about director Samir Karnik's final film of a trilogy (Nanhe Jaisalmer, Heroes) is its utterly pointless EQ.  We have heard the story a zillion times.

But Ruslaan neither has the urgency of breaking news or the perspective of a docu-drama. In fact, the film's first half reminds you of the 1970s family socials and is good enough to give a headache to even a Saridon.  In the second half, the film warms up by its own standards. The bomb blast, followed by the arrest and the police torture of the protagonist, gives Ruslaan a sense of focus. But we soon realize that director Mohan C Sharma and writers Brahma-Dhruv are simply not up to the task. The only redeeming feature is that they take care to represent every point of view.  Daughter of 1970s heroine, Moushumi Chatterjee, debutant Meghaa speaks faster than Sholay's motormouth Basanti in the first half and reminds you of the healthy-looking leading ladies of the same era. Hero Raajveer fares better in comparison. But that's not saying much.

Just like the kattas (locally-made guns) manufactured and sold in the mean bylanes of hundreds of qasbahs across the state. It's a recession-proof cottage industry.  In the badlands of Uttar Pradesh, death can also come for the flimsiest of reasons. Even a row over a gilli-danda game can spiral into a murder as it happens for Baabarr Qureshi. And the event can just be a great career move in extortion and contract killings. That's how the life of Baabarr and his band of brothers unfurls.  With exceptions like the vastly under-feted Sehar (2005), not many films have journeyed into the bowels of the murky crime world of Uttar Pradesh. But right from the paan-stained walls, the charpois, the milky tea, the abattoirs with those scary butcher's knives, the claustrophic bylanes, cheek-by-jowl rooftops with flying kites -- Amanganj is rich in details. We get the feeling of watching something raw and real.  But, more than that, director Trikha (Alag, Deewanapan) and writer Ikram Akhtar also provide a feel of the ethos, the motivations, the values and attitudes of places like Amanganj where criminals become demi-gods. A small boy serving tea imitates the superstar criminal Baabaar's mannerisms and says, \"Hum unke liye jaan bhi de sakte hain.\" The dialogues (Akhtar and Vivek Mishra) flavoured with Urdu words are again spot-on. And using a young boy's voice-over as a sutradhar is a neat little idea that works fine.  If Baabarr - why is everybody into numerology? - fails to create a firm impression, it's because director Trikha gets only the mood right, not the scenes. The killings of the rich businessman, the small-time contractor are shoddily constructed, almost amateurish. On occasions, the movie becomes a series of repetitive violent scenes even though the chase sequences, especially where Baabarr chases his rival Tabrez (an impressive Sushant Singh), are neatly executed. And, one wonders, whether the final twists in the tale are only for shock value, or they flow out of the narrative.  As Baabarr, Soham shows promise. In the role of an honest but one-dimensional, humourless cop, Mithun is alright. But it is Om Puri as the oily, wily and crooked cop, who steals the show.

She lies down on the bed and says, \"Hey boys, enjoy your Manchurian.\" They do.  Get the picture? If not, sample this. The same father-in-law (Sharat Saxena) feeds the hero with plenty of black gram - sabji, salad and kebabs -- hoping the sound-filled act that follows will disgust his daughter. The hero does oblige with what rhymes with go-karting. But the ploy fails because her daughter finds it cute too. Whoever said love stinks.  Bachelor Party then is coarse comedy. The problem is that all the risque gags notwithstanding, the movie is simply not funny enough. Even the more serious attempts at humour -- the Osama-Bush spoof, for instance - fall flat. One might recall that director Ishaan Trivedi had earlier made 7 1/2 Phere (2005), a sensible but under-rated comedy that sank quietly at the box-office. This time Trivedi stoops but still fails to conquer.

But life seems to have other plans for him. Time and again, he becomes an accidental hero. And, the terrorist who has come by sea would rather blow up the Mumbai police headquarters than fall in love with a singer in the bar.  On the face of it, Aagey Se Right has all the ingredients, including a great cast, to be a side-splitting feast of laughter. Instead the movie is like a high-speed automobile without controls. The story keeps taking random turns - not only Aagey Se Right - but left and centre too. And sometimes, it almost drives itself over the cliff. That's because director Indrajit Nattoji gets greedy with the gags -- he wants one every second and only a few work -- without really caring about a neatly constructed plot.

Not that the film is an angry or persuasive visual document like Aakrosh or Ardh Satya, but director-cinematographer Mazhar Khan's maiden offering shows a willingness to engage and dares to raise uncomfortable questions that feel-good Bollywood prefers to ignore these days.  Written by renowned Hindi writer Uday Prakash (Peeli Chhatri Wali Ladki), the film takes you to the heart of hinterland darkness where ordinary people can be twisted and tossed away to suit the needs of the influential, where a man's identity is stolen, his job peddled away without a murmur of protest. It's both ironical and metaphorical that the protagonist's name is Mohandas, though his surname is not Gandhi, and that the honest judge is named Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh, the pioneer of modern Hindi poetry.  The film is a grim tale of corruption that links top to bottom"},{"Name":"Three - Love, Lies and Betrayal","Release Time":"Apr 11 2016","Critic rating":"2.5/5","Cast":"Ashish Chowdhry, Nausheen Ali Sardar, Akshay Kapoor, Achint Kaur","Director":"Vishal Pandya","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":"2 hours 6 minutes","Review":" She drives a flashy car, dresses chic and lives with her husband in a dream house by a lake in Scotland. But, believe it or not, she is strapped for cash. That's because her husband is a loser.  He's cantankerous too. \"She wears the pants, I wear the skirts,\" he complains after getting drunk. They aren't cross-dressers; he is simply stating who controls the remote of their relationship. After a fight when his wife wants to make up in the traditional, time-tested way, the hubby stops her midway, saying he doesn't deserve her. One can't help agreeing with him.  So when a smooth-talking young singer (Ashish Chowdhry) at a local pub moves in as a tenant, he easily gets into her heart and bed. That's when the twists and turns in the plot begin to unravel, each character turning out to be a bigger scumbag than the other. As one of them says about another in the end, you are the winner of the kamina competition.  Bollywood, especially the Bhatts, have done the \"love, lies and betrayal\" thing several times before. But producer Vikram Bhatt knows how to rustle up a slick, smart yarn and the director, his ex-assistant, seems a good learner. Neatly crafted, with each character clearly etched, the film never loses its single-mindedness and pace. Innovative use of nursery rhymes -- Jack and Jill and Humpty Dumpty -- create the illusion of novelty in the dialogue. And Bhatt might just get a three nights-four days free stay from Scotland tourism for making the countryside look so serene.  But the movie's biggest drawback is that its actors neither have box-office pull nor the charm to hold attention. We really don't care who wins or loses. Debutant Nausheen emotes well but occasionally seems to be impersonating a ghost. And the music, once a highlight of Bhatt movies, is disappointingly tepid. Three just falls short of being a three-star affair.

Here policemen are unemployed because the crime rate is zero and everyone goes on a nirjal upwaas as penance after telling a lie. Hadhbahedi's neighbour and 'other' is Trifala, a village of vice teeming with liquor shops and wheeler-dealers.  In this setting, director Ranjit Kapoor paratroops his boorish protagonist Chintuji, played by Rishi Kapoor, and cleverly fuses facts from the actor's real life with fiction. The movie could have been an amiable tale of individual redemption but the director (also dialogue writer of the cult comedy, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron) aims for a more ambitious canvas by trying to create a parallel contemporary parable on the different models of development.  The movie has some neat vignettes and cameos. It has a rickshawala called Antonioni Pandey, a struggler called Paplu Yadav, who calls up his jijaji railway minister to get a train stopped at an unscheduled station and a song called Akira Kurosawa with the name of all the top directors of world cinema.

The film's title is taken from a Boney M number that everyone jived to in the 1980s and which is rather carelessly inserted in an uninspiring track.  And much of the film is a photocopy of Death at a Funeral, a zany 2007 comedy recently doing the rounds on a movie channel.  What works partially in the movie's favour is its high-pitched, manic energy. Director K Murli Mohan Rao doesn't really let the pace slacken in the first half though a readymade template would have simplified his life.  There's a scene that pretty much sums up the movie's mood. One of the characters, played by Jaffrey, lifts his paralysed uncle Murphy (Prem Chopra) and tries to make him sit on the commode. The foul-mouthed uncle is desperate to ease his bowels. Accidentally, Jaffrey's hand gets stuck in the contraption and Murphy ends up letting it out on his unfortunate hand. It is gross, asinine and immensely funny.  The movie's whacky ensemble includes a struggling writer (Shetty) who is bullied by his wife, a character whose wife suspects he is sleeping around and a cousin whose boyfriend (Aftab) has mistakenly taken hallucinogenic pills. But none of them are as interesting or intriguing as the pint-sized stranger (Rajpal Yadav) who walks in and lovingly fondles the coffin. It is his disclosures that lead to a situational comedy that leaves you with half a smile after the show is over.  The movie has some moments of originality too. The coffin is brought by a company called Coffin with Karan. For some strange reason, the pocket-sized gay is named Andrew Symonds, physically the exact opposite of the Australian cricketer. But nothing is more eye-popping than Sophie Choudhry running in a bikini on the beach in slow motion. Even Usain Bolt would have found it hard to match her big and bouncy strides.

A spoof on the obese but unputdownable action heroes of Tamil potboilers, the cowboy enamoured an entire generation of young couch tomatoes with his flashy clothes and flamboyant antics in snappy promos played between songs.  And SRK's Yanna rascala in Om Shanti Om and MS Dhoni's Mind It act for a cola company show his memory endures.  Now QGM arrives on the big screen in a familiar green shirt that only Govinda would have dared to wear, with tight orange trousers that could suffocate a stray bug, a flashing pink scarf, a leopard spotted jacket, white boots and a whiter cowboy hat barking the opening line, \"The earth is my bed. The sky is my ceiling. The whole world is my native place,\" in accented English that smells as much of fresh sambar as of an old-fashioned open heartedness.  Over the next hour and half, QGM fires bullets through the frizzy hair of a rowdy named Gunpowder. He survives hoodlums flying from one tree to another (as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) hurling coconuts like grenades. And he finally battles Rice Plate Reddy, the mean and vicious villain who hates vegetarian dosa and dreams of selling the world's most popular non-vegetarian dosa in his food chain, McDosa. He is assisted by Mango Dolly (Rambha) --- one look at her and you can guess how she got that name -- the moll who flaunts a golden wig with her golden heart. In between, there are memorable lines such as, \"If you are lightning, I am 250 volt current.\"  Does that sound like a rip-roaring entertainer? The problem with QGM is that it is not half as good on celluloid as it sounds as an idea. To make a smooth transition from a TV filler to a full-length feature, QGM needed more than mere attitude. But it ends up feeling like a spoof of a spoof.  The movie, though, has its moments. The action scenes occasionally raise a chuckle. In the climax, Murugan even grabs a bullet fired at him in his mouth. Some of the gags work. And Rajendra Prasad gets the protagonist's part right. His exchanges with Rambha offer the most endearing and hilarious moments of the film. When Dolly confesses having failed to win a beauty contest, he says, \"It is not IAS. You can try again.\"  You cannot blame director Shashanka Ghosh and writer Rajesh Devraj for not trying something different. They are bang on with the movie's looks. Too bad, the team fails to create its soul.

He doesn't really agree with his boss, master chef (Saurabh Shukla), a philosopher in the kitchen, who reminds him of the futility of running after 99 women when the special one could be around the corner. Pyaar uss se karna chahiye jisse pyar mile, he says.  But wisdom doesn't come easy to Vir, a rake driven by hormones and a no-scruples quest for upward mobility. Essentially, Love Khichdi is his rites of passage. The boy from Chandigarh has to step over a minefield of women, taste love and heartbreak, before finding his true value girl at the end.  What lifts this smart-assed flick above the mundane is its attention to detail. Every character in the film, major or minor, is neatly rounded. We have not only seen them somewhere close by; we also wish to see them somewhere close by. Cool and sexy without getting risque, director Srinivas Bhashyam turns Vir's journey as a fantasy fulfiller for the young, urban male. In the end, we want him to make the right choice. And when he does, it feels good.  In its narrative technique, Love Khichdi uses two innovations. The minor one is the sach ki ghanti, a bell that rings whenever the hero speaks the truth. It sort of underlines the moment. But more than that it is getting each character to talk to the audience in a soul searching, confessional mode that works as a neat narrative device. The technique allows us to peep into the heart of every character, know their motivations.  It helps that the characters are sharply delineated. There's the simple girl next door Sandhya Iyengar, a pal he croons happy birthday to, drunk late night, using a lighter as a candle. There's coquettish Punjaban Parminder Kaur (Divya Dutta), a regular scene-stealer in another scene stealing act and the husband-hating hot maid (Sonali Kulkarni) whom Vir gives the (allegedly) Shiney Ahuja sort of look. Then there is the bookstore woman played by Rituparna Sengupta, the tough cookie corporate who gets the better of him, and the hot Gujju schoolgirl (Riya Sen), who is too sexy for her skirt.  Director Srinivas Bhasyam gets great work from the ensemble. Among those who stand out are Kulkarni, Dutta and Shukla (in that order). Hooda too looks the part. What adds to the movie is a mood-enhancing track that runs through the first half.

Or a hi-tech problem? Or better still a car problem? Worry not. Jack of all trades Arjun Sherawat hai na. Now that's another story that our multi-tasking hero leaves a rather shadowy impact on the things he lays his hands on.  And that is? Scuba diving, jumping off multi-storeyed buildings, not missing any target even by an inch, wooing leading girls, kidnapping corrupt netas and builders via hi-tech laptops and toy cars, zip zap zooming on busy roads of Thailand, routing all his calls via America so that he never gets caught, taking a stroll between tigers and of course, his primary profession -- repairing automobiles. That's just not what one has to go through. After every car is repaired in his garage (remember not more than five minutes!), the nothing-is-impossible hero shows us his moves with scantily clad ladies and the missing musical link. That's just the eye washer. The real big picture is that he is a serial killer and kidnapper of politicos, builders... oops he's not a traitor for he kills/kidnaps only rapists! And that's how the whodunit thriller turns into a whydunnit shadowy tale.  Reasons enough for leading lady Sanjana Rajpoot (Sonali Kulkarni) to fall in love with Mr Sherawat. Minus all romance, for we are never told how and when it all happens. Or was it Sonali's five minute soliloquy? Keep guessing. All we know is that our lady supercop cannot handle press conferences, the questioning media, her dad as a senior cop. In fact, the character's more convincing as a shrink who has a word of advice on the complicated lives we lead for yet another frivolous character, reporter Sheetal Pradhan (Hrishita Bhatt).  Time to take stock of the ubiquitous Bollywood cliche. Why is it cops reach the area of crime quite late in the day? Case in point Mr underutilised reporter Rahul Kapoor (Milind Soman)!  But if there's something that's quite clear in this blurred Shadow, it's Naseer Khan (Arjun Sherawat), who despite being physically challenged in real life manages to carry out stunts with ease and confidence in reel life. Yes, he refuses to play blind on screen. Kudos to that for sure! As for his performance, it remains shadowy, not just for his robotic dialogue delivery but also his complete misfit as the lover boy (yes, there are moments when you wish Milind Soman wooed our super cop) and as a diehard vigilante masquerading as a killer. Cinema doesn't work on human bravado alone.

We have had a similar theme in the lyrical Santosh Sivan's 'Tahaan' before, but 'Sikandar' is racy, taut and unfolds like an edge of the seat thriller. Needless to say, the beautiful landscape of Kashmir juxtaposed against the jagged political reality plays an important character in the film and the recurring leit motif in the pursuit of aman.  Yes, futility of jihad, guns, war, terrorism, violence just got redefined through the eyes of school-going Sikandar (Parzan Dastur) and Nasreen (Ayesha Kapoor). But only after our teen protagonist realises that his dream of becoming a football champ... his dream of being the ultimate hero... his dream of buying a washer-cum-dryer for his aunt... his dream of giving it back to the school bully cannot be attained at gun point even though Sikandar initially believes he's laid his hands on ``kaala jaadu'' (black magic) that could solve all his problems for him.  All this and more, as director Piyush Jha presents figures typically representative of the present day J&K problem. First there is Lt Colonel Rao (Madhavan), the army commander of the area who uses force to bring peace and yet practices the doctrine of the second chance; Mukhtaar Mattoo (Sanjay Suri), a reformed militant leader who wants to play peacemaker between the army, militants and religious leaders. And finally Zahgeer Quadir (Arunoday Singh), the most feared militant leader of the Kashmir Azaadi Force wanted for 72 killings and 22 bombings.  But what really has us asking for more and more is the screen presence of Sikandar (Parzan Dastur) who doesn't want ``ladkiyon ka sahara'' to face the school bully, even as he wonders why a ``ladki'' fails to understand the importance of ``ladai'' for ``aman''. Adding to that is confidante Nasreen (Ayesha Kapoor) who each time mistakes ``das nishane'' for ``das football goals'', enjoys her little moments of bliss with her new found MP3, courtesy her dad who takes pride in his gul-e-Kashmir. The shattering teenager innocence is beautifully executed, low on words, strong on expression, culminating in stunning climax. Not to miss out is the cool and calculative Sanjay Suri and the tough officer with a heart, Madhavan. A special mention for debutant Arunoday Singh not just because he easily recognises the make and model of a gun. Or for his free-of-cost training sessions to the I-want-to-be-my-hero teen, but for a strong, convincing performance. A l'il more would not have been bad!  In other words, no bhashan on cross border terror, war, militancy.

It's over the top. It has Genelia forcing you to reach out for earplugs, ever so often. And yet it's easy timepass.  Credit it to the comic timing of Govinda who manages to make slapstick seem funny, despite his guest appearance kind of role.Or credit it to a mere peppering of some really funny sequences, specially a cameo from Jagdeep who steals the show with mere grunts and half-sentences. Actually speaking, Fardeen and Tusshar too manage to hook your attention with their exuberance. If Fardeen skilfully does the shift from indulgent lover to irate husband with a non-wifey material, Genelia, then Tusshar plays the papa-dominated Gujju chokra to the hilt. With his oiled hair and his daddy phobia, he's quite a funny husband to the independent-minded, IIM graduate, Prachi Desai.  The setting is Cape Town. Govinda, an inveterate playboy, gives his buddies some friendly advice during the umpteen beer summits they share. (Of course, good boy Tusshar just drinks Coke!) He tells them never to get married because the institution of marriage is akin to jumping into a well. Sane advice? Nah! Tusshar settles down for a good old arranged marriage with his dad's friend's daughter, Prachi, while Fardeen is forced into marriage by his hyper girlfriend, Genelia who has been spoilt rotten by her dad, Anupam Kher. The aftermath is easy to envisage. Tusshar's marriage falls prey to his papa's domineering ways and Fardeen calls it quits because he can't bear coming home to burnt toast, a burnt washing machine and a burned down house, courtesy his domestically challenged wife.

Naturally, when a film maker brings you a film on this issue, you look forward to a script that not only dissects the problem, but also talks about social acceptance and suggests ways of coping with it. After all, covert abortions aren't the only solution, specially in a country that treats abortion as illegal.  But does Satish Kaushik's film actually treat teen pregnancy as an issue? Not really. For him, it is a cute angle for a cute love story...almost in sync with Bobby, Qayamat se Qayamat Tak and Love Story. These films focussed on young lovers on the run, minus the pregnancy part. Here too, the director chooses to devote an entire second half to the soppy sentimentalism of two teenagers who try to build a secret home, complete with candles, teddy bears and Maggi noodles. Of course, they do bother about the economics. But that isn't much of a bother. The boy lifts bricks or gas cylinders, while the girl sells fruits in the local bazaar. Anything about social acceptance here?  But don't be totally disappointed, because there is the first half too. Now this one's a breezy take on teenage romance which draws its charm from the performances. If rich girl Sheena and poor boy Ruslaan are perfect as the pair of young lovers, then their parents are picture perfect too. Satish Kaushik and Sushmita Mukherjee are adorable as the old Delhi couple who may not have the moolah but do have a surplus of love and affection for their son, Ruslaan. Rajat Kapoor and Neena Gupta, on the other hand, are the archetypal arrogant upper middle class couple who prefer to leave their daughter with butlers and nannys, being hard-pressed for time. It's the class confrontation between auto rickshaw driver Satish Kaushik and high-profile lawyer Rajat Kapoor that makes for some interesting moments, with the actors slipping into their roles with elan.  But the failure of the film to highlight the trauma of teen pregnancy in a closed society does rankle a bit. Specially when it comes after the bold and refreshing Juno that was both meaningful and entertaining.

Even Darna Mana Hai had its moments, as did his earlier foray into the danger-infested forest, Jungle. But Agyaat is completely cold meat. It neither thrills nor chills with its repetitive running-for-life sequences and its absolutely infuriating end which offers no explanation whatsoever for the scurrying and screaming. Director Ram Gopal Varma surely owes the viewers some explanation for the identity of the Thing that has been causing supposed mayhem in the jungle. Fine, he wants a sequel and all that. But part one too needs a plausible end, doesn't it?  Essentially, this one is a chase movie, where an unseen predator follows a film unit and preys upon them, one by one. The crew decides to go for a camping trip in the dense interiors, when their camera breaks down after a bekaar item song. There, in the dead of night, they spot a falling star, which marks the beginning of their end. First, their guide disappears, only to reappear as a grotesque carcass (you only get to see a bloody eye), then the producer is reduced to a riverine of curdling blood. All that the remaining becharas can do is rant at each other, stare vacantly into space and shiver as the soundtrack unsuccessfully tries to scare you with grunts and wails.  In fact, all that the director does is to rely on his camera and audio track to rustle up the horror. But it takes more than the rustle of the leaves, the growl of the night creatures and the howl of a beast to scare the die-hard film buff. Even Priyanka Kothari's wide-eyed stare and incessant pout fails to emphasise the `Boo' factor.  Yes, this one's completely devoid of the fear factor. Wonder if part two will scare you?

So much so, Chal Chalein might have turned out to be an eye-opener of a film, which comes in tandem with our new HRD minister's attempts to de-traumatise education.  It could actually have been a strong and much-needed indictment of parental pressure that is turning GenNow into a bunch of robots forcibly being programmed to join the army of engineers and doctors, spawned by the sundry IITs and medical colleges. Sadly, the grand sermonising and the prolonged court room sequences convert the film into a tedious experience, which loses much of its bite. Wonder how many kids would actually be able to sit through the boring monologues that form the entire second half, where the drama shifts to the courtroom and lawyer Mithun Chakraborty chooses to put everyone in the dock.

Young Adhyayan Suman may not have the screen presence and the star charisma to carry a film forward, but he does have an earnestness that shines through his boy-next-door looks. And it is this sincerity and grit that invests the film with a raw appeal, despite its predictable storyline and its run-of-the-mill relationships. And when he has Shahana Goswami for support, rest assured, even run-of-the-mill becomes watchable.  How many times have you seen elder sister slaving it out in bed to support her spoilt younger brother? Umpteen. Yet, despite having whimpered and sobbed in so many masala films, this brother and sister duo do not evoke a sense of deja vu. Simply because the emotions are real, the anguish is raw and the conflict naked.  Elder sis, Shahana chooses to become the mistress of a wealthy business man (Humayun Saeed) in order to provide a decent, upper middle class life for herself and her brother. But she's no doormat, our doughty vixen. She hollers drunkenly at her benefactor, clamours for marriage and claws away at his insults, but only until it isn't `pehli tareeq'. Because, pragmatism demands she pipes down on the first of every month, before the bills start pouring in and the payments have to be made. All this, while junior chases dreams of becoming a rock star and spends aimless hours jamming with his boy band in a decrepit garage. Occasionally, he loses his cool, when sis makes a fool of herself before their benefactor and asks him to apologise, for the moolah to flow. Trouble brews when he falls in love with the biz tycoon's little sister (Anjana Sukhani) and finds his dream dying in the face of stark and brutal reality. Time for a descent into hell, before the phoenix to rise....  Predictable, didn't we say. But hey, Jashnn isn't just a story with a lot of heart. It's told with in a heartwarming way too, with moments that touch you with their naked pain. Watch Adhyayan trying to steal a woman's purse in a pub to pay his bills or scribble a sorry note in the tycoon's office; and hear Shahana mumble about marriage and commitment to an unresponsive lover or have her brother hold a mirror to her"},{"Name":"Dekh Re Dekh","Release Time":"Apr 8 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Vijay Raaz, Gracy Singh, Raghubir Yadav, Siddharth Koirala","Director":"Rahat Kazmi","Genre":"Action","Duration":"1 hour 48 minutes"},{"Name":"Morning Walk","Release Time":"Apr 8 2016","Critic rating":"3.0/5","Cast":"Anupam Kher, Sharmila Tagore, Rajit Kapoor, Divya Dutta","Director":"Arup Dutta","Genre":"Action","Duration":"1 hour 40 minutes"},{"Name":"Short Kut: The Con Is On","Release Time":"Apr 8 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Akshaye Khanna, Arshad Warsi, Amrita Rao","Director":"Neeraj Vora","Genre":"Action","Duration":"2 hours 10 minutes","Review":" Was this supposed to be a comedy? If so, why doesn't the film make you laugh even once? Why do the jokes fall flat? Why are the witty one-liners ekdum pathetic? And why does Arshad Warsi have to pitch in one of his most nerve-wracking performances as the minus-all-morals low life who is infuriatingly blase about stealing scripts and walking over people? And if it isn't a comedy, it surely couldn't be a serious take on dosti-dushmani and diabolical friends. Simply because this friendship-turned-sour story doesn't touch you even once. Then kya? Khaali-peeli time-pass? Nah! Because time doesn't pass; it literally drags while watching this undefined venture.  Ostensibly, a remake of a successful Tamil film, Short Kut tries to make a dig at instant stardom and luck, by chance in Bollywood. Here, in tinsel town, talent often takes time to find a platform, while deceit, treachery and mediocrity flourish faster. Raju (Arshad Warsi), an unscrupulous extra, steals best friend, Shekhar's (Akshaye Khanna) blockbuster script and becomes a star. The distraught scriptwriter who dreamed of becoming a hot shot director goes into depression and then bounces back with an offer to direct his second script. The problem however is the hero who happens to be none other than Raju, the super crook superstar. Time to teach the wicked fellow a few lessons, decide Shekhar and his friends.  Time also to wonder why the film ended up so lacklustre and unfunny. Also, what exactly was Amrita Rao doing in this film, other than displaying her newly acquired oomph? Surely, there can be no short kuts to comedy, can there!

If Superman Brandon Routh and Holly Valance have a split second role, then Denise Richards and Sylvester Stallone are just eye candy. They have nothing to do in the film, other than make a glossy guest appearance and win a peck and a Punjabi thank-you speech from the ever-grateful Indian hero. One abridged action sequence definitely wouldn't be enough for Sly fans who would go looking for some John Rambo chutzpah in a desi flick.  So what really works in Kambakkht Ishq. Merely the gloss and a valiant effort on the part of Akshay Kumar to keep the laughs trickling in, here and there, with his off-beat sense of timing. But when the situations aren't too comic, there isn't much an actor can do to tickle your funny bone. Kareena, on the other hand, is a complete let-down. Despite her haute-coutured look, her micro minis, her pencil heels, she comes across as a completely unconvincing supermodel cum surgeon. It's a laboured, pouty attempt to accentuate the oomph, when actually the actress doesn't need to fake it. Remember her effortless and completely natural `Pooh' act in Kabhi Khusi Kabhie Gham? Also, what exactly are Jaaved Jaaffrey and Boman Irani doing in this film? Again, two fine actors who bear the brunt of an under-written, clumsy role that's neither here nor there. If Jaafrey's a greedy NRI who calls himself a su-er (he loves to sue every American), then Boman is a one-scene doctor who is trapped in a Dostana-like sequence with patient Akshay. Not funny at all.  Surely, it take more than Jimmy Choo, Prada, Versace and LA to make a film that can tickle and entertain. Million dollar looks and a multi-crore budget can't make up for characters and a kahaani.

Try as you might, you just can't keep pace with this deafening run-all-the-way film which sees the hero (Amarjeet) either relentlessly running after people with a gun or running from people with a gun. Sometimes, he is running after Shawar Ali, a small time don somewhere in Malaysia and sometimes, he is being chased by Lucky Ali, another contract killer with no identity.  Who are these people, you might ask. Who knows and who cares. Because there is hardly any thing to hold your attention here. The hero Amarjeet sports no emotions at all. Shawar Ali and Lucky Ali have nothing to say or do, other than sport guns and ride cars and bikes. Deepal Shaw, the hero's first girl friend, is dispensed with in the first few reels as a pallid bride on the cold death bed. And Tulip Joshi is given the customary item number which she performs minus all passion, before she becomes the hero's arm candy and conduit in crime.

At least, now there will be some quality control amongst films that are produced by respectable banners, one had thought. Ironically, the brand equity of big film producing companies always takes a nose dive when films like Tashan, Kal Kisne Dekha and now Paying Guests hits the screen. Tell us seriously, did nobody even bother to whet the script or take a trial run of the film before putting in all the big bucks behind it? Truly, what a waste of time, money and even talent. For actors like Shreyas Talpade have already proved their forte at both serious and light stuff (remember Iqbal and Dor). So why did he have to accept a film which sees him prancing around crudely as an over made, over the top drag queen for most of the film. And if that wasn't atrocious enough, there is Jaaved Jaffrey, again a fine actor, playing a completely kitschy Kareena to Talpade's Karisma. And mind you, in this age of high couture cross dressing, our drag queens still believe in stuffing tennis balls up their vests! Can't get more DM (down market) than this, can you?  The two are forced to don the grotesque wigs and grimy make-up in order to convince the sardar couple to take them in as paying guests. Mr and Ms Sardar don't mind speaking in lewd terms, but they do mind renting out their rooms to unmarried people. Hence the four male friends become two happily married couples (Ashish Chowdhury and Shreyas Talpade, Vatsal Seth and Jaaved Jaffrey) and weave their way into the family hearth and heart. Trouble begins when the sundry girl friends arrive for the mandatory song and dance numbers and the sardarji's greedy sibling (Chunkey Pandey in a terrible act) tries to grab his moolah.  It's a completely chaotic story that keeps hurtling towards doom from the word go. Presumably a comedy, the film actually ends up making you cry -- in sheer frustration -- rather than send you in splits. The jokes are in terrible taste, where even rape is trivialised, and the actors sleepwalk their way through most of the film. Come on guys, exercise some quality control.

Quite understandable, since it markets the eternal Indian tale of rebirth against a sylvan backdrop of the picturesque hills and tea plantations of Ooty.  Vijayendra Ghatge's estranged son, Vic (Carlucci Weyant), comes on a short trip to India on the behest of his newly wed American wife, Anna (Alma Saraci) who wants to rebuild the frayed family relationships. The palatial mansion suddenly perks up with the new arrivals, even as Anna seems to be revelling in her newfound family ties, while husband Vic is still sceptical of his father. The dad and daughter-in-law bond instantly hits off, but for Anna's sudden visitations which see her remebering people and places she's never seen before. Things get worse when Anna sees the ghost of Linda (Claudia Siesla), an Austrian woman who died in strange circumstances in the near-by forest, almost twenty years ago. Her search leads her to strange people and places in the small town, with her memory downloading dramatic flashes from the distant past, much to the discomfiture of husband Vic who doesn't really believe her mumbo jumbo. But only until he digs up old newspaper clippings from the internet which talk about the mysterious disappearance of an Austrian tourist in Ooty. Is Anna actually Linda? No prizes for guessing.  The story may be archaic, but the film carries you along with its thriller pace, its twist in the tale and the visual splendour of splendid Ooty.

The trio not only manage to save babaji's home and family, they also bring about a change of heart in the diehard dada who gives up his unholy ways. And how do they manage this gargantuan task?

With hardly any hype and a title that says nothing, this film sure does come as a surprise. First, because the kids actually act as kids. The boy Hanuman is quite adorable in his unkempt slacks and his passion for swinging on a tyre, when not saving the world. The elders are either delightfully cruel, like Sushmita Mukherjee or genteel and kind like Chandrachur Singh and the film mercifully doesn't have any overt morals to preach to all us paapis. Of course, the animation (just a part of the film) could have been better. But we'll ignore that.  So what does it have? A neat little story, told with panache, almost like a fairy tale. Young Rameshwari loses her mother and finds solace in the larger-than-life Hanuman statue near her house. Of course, she loves her dad (Chandrachur Singh) and dad loves her too, but there's the wimpish step mom and her outrageously villanish mother (Sushmita Mukherjee) who wants the little girl out of the way. So Rameshwari turns to her best buddy Hanuman for help who takes on a boyish avtar and enters her home, without disclosing his god status. The rest is all funs and games, as boy-god Hanuman first teaches cruel mom's cruel brother a lesson and then turns his attention to her, mumbo-jumbo, tantriks etc.  Take your kids. They'll have a good time with this good versus evil tale.

There are no more stories left to tell about history's tumultuous times, unless you can add a new spin to it.

Now that becomes quite tiring for the viewer, specially since each psychic encounter ends up with a half-dead Akshay who needs electric shocks and blood transfusion to bring him back to life.  There's nothing really to cheer you up in the desultory proceedings, unless you want to watch chubby-cheeked Ayesha and lissome Akshay go mountain biking when he's not squirming in the time machine. A few moments of levity are provided by Javed Jaffrey as the edgy ex-cop who speaks Hyderabadi. But mostly, the actors are let down by the unexciting script. Specially Akshay, who tries to be earnest, to no avail. As for who done it? Try believing Kukunoor's explanation. Ekdum irrational.

Now this seems hard to stomach from a filmmaker who has given us hard-hitting films like Fire, Earth and Water.  The film scores mainly in its cinematography (Giles Nuttgen) which captures the claustrophobic interiors of the NRI existence with chilling close-ups. Preity's new home is a festering ghetto, spilling over with disgruntled people who left their homes in search of paradise. And ended up with no hope, no space, no pride. Preity Zinta too puts in a powerful performances as the de-glamourised, disenchanted young bride, but the rebellion comes too late and the snake-lore, complete with a nag-pariksha, seems too bizarre in a 21st century denouement of domestic violence.

And before he knows, he's gently sucked into the chaos himself. Specially when he can't understand why firebrand Imarti (Divya Dutta) is an untouchable; why the unfriendly neighbourhood cop (Vijay Raaz) has a Hitler fetish; why his uncles (Om Puri, Pavan Malhotra) have built a wall in their house, while their wives gossip relentlessly through a loose brick. Or else, why the beautiful Bittu (Sonam Kapoor) chooses to have her wings clipped, like the white dove, Masakali, when she too can fly and fulfil her dreams.  And if that isn't dramatic enough to hold our boy back to where he belongs, there's the infamous Monkey Man and his escapades that became an urban legend in saddi Dilli, not so long ago. The filmmaker interestingly uses the metaphor of the Monkey Man (Kala Bandar) to symbolise the beast within and blends different vignettes of contemporary India to create a composite picture. One that holds up the mirror to the modern Indian and shows him up as both heroic and beastly; communal and comrade-like. Ironically, it is this metaphor which becomes stretched and almost funny in the climax, drawing away from the appeal of the film. The shoddy climax, replete with a scene from heaven, and the sluggish pace of the film do detract from the delicious flavour of Delhi 6, which, all said and done, is a delectable paapdi-chaat of big, bustling, bulging India. The director creates a whole gallery of mesmeric characters, though one wishes he had focussed a bit more on bubbly Bittu, specially since Sonam has such a pleasant screen presence.  Unfortunately, she's left as a mere sketch on this colourful canvas, where, once again, Abhishek Bachchan proves he's in crackling, quicksilver form as the 'burger-chaap' Amrikan who tells his bustee wallahs to 'get real'. Rahman's Masakali music has already become a chartbuster, even as veterans like Waheeda and Rishi reiterate the truism about old being absolute gold. Watch it for the message of Delhi 6 and the ekdum desi India-feel.

As the brooding, prescient painter, who paints death on his canvas and falls in love with one of subjects, he is suitably aggrieved, desperate and afraid. Debutante Adhyayan Suman too manages to hold his own between these two experienced players and manages to infuse his character with the requisite degree of mystery.  movie  The plot is predictable. Kangana, a model moves in with her boyfriend (Adhyayan) in a brand new house and begins to experience strange occurrences in her bath tub, in front of her mirror, on her bed. Her bf, a TV reporter who specialises in reality spook shows, dismisses her misgivings and treats her with the disdain that is the due of all fretful, flighty femme fatales.  Enter, Emraan, the psychic painter who forewarns her of the hocus-pocus that lies ahead in her life. She is forced to believe him when her bath tub almost drowns her and a strange apparition almost slashes her up. The two end up on a crusade to find out the Raaz which leads them towards an Erin Brokovich kinda climax about corporate and personal greed versus individual valour.  Horrifying? Certainly, in places, especially when an ATM turns nasty, a bunch of bisons turn murderous, Kangana gets transformed into an abusive man or has her wrists slit in the bath tub. The film however gets wrapped up in a clumsy climax, as most horror films do and does tend to drag in places.  Nevertheless, director Mohit Suri does manage to get his groove back a bit, after a series of insignificant films that followed the power-packed Kalyug. Watch it for the chemistry between the Gangster pair and for a couple of goosebumps, here and there.

The film is low on both IQ and EQ. On the one hand, the story rambles incoherently.

You might end up applauding some of the action cuts, where our one-man-army showcases his expertise with chopsucky, but this ain't no crouching tiger, Shaolin chamber, fist of fury footwork.  While Akshay relentlessly plays over the top, Deepika looks lost and forlorn for most of the film. Ranvir Shorey, was that you? Tch Tch! The only decent act comes from that old warhorse, Mithunda who tries to bring some normalcy in the proceedings.  Somewhere in the tamasha, Akshay confesses he doesn't care if he was Liu Sheng or a macchar (mosquito) in his last birth. Frankly, my dear, even we wouldn't give a damn! Maybe Drona would.

Fashion too falls prey to this inbuilt bias of the director's creative vision and introduces a degree of predictability in the plot. The first half of the film is a relentless replay of all the cliches one would associate with the world of glamour. Small town girls need to shed their middle class morality before they can scale the ladder of success.  movie  Successful models are sad, lonely, broken people, addicted to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. Godfathers are cruel, manipulative, exploitative. And last but not least, Brokeback Mountain isn't just a film for male fashion designers; it's a lifestyle statement for most of them.  Mercifully, Fashion isn't about cliches alone and manages to transcend them with it's moving tale of three women who try to maintain their honour, dignity, identity in a cruel world that spills over with grime behind the glamour. The film not only takes you behind the psychedelic ramp, it travels through the dark inner recesses of the three lead characters, laying bare their strengths and weaknesses; their fears and hopes; their dreams and nightmares.  If Meghna Mathur's (Priyanka Chopra) journey from Chandigarh to Mumbai is a tortuous coming-of-age sojourn for a small town girl who dreams to become a super model, then reigning diva, Shonali Gujral (Kangana Ranaut) travels through her own personal inferno, ending up totally singed when the arc lights fade. Between them is Janet Sequeira (Mughda Godse), the high on EQ model who chose to make her own compromises by giving up her career and settling down in a faux marriage with her gay designer friend, Samir Soni. Three distinct women who make a choice between success and failure, sanity and insanity, life and loneliness...and create a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment.  Dramatically, it's Priyanka's journey that is the most comprehensive as it tackles her growth from an ambitious, young girl to an arrogant model who fails to handle her success, crumbles and then rises again, like the proverbial Phoenix. The actress delivers a competent performance and yet, has tough competition from the other two girls.  Debutante Mughda pitches in a confident portrayal of the sweet and sensitive buddy. But the show stopper (read scene stealer) is crazy, kinky, Kangana who does an exquisite metamorphosis from a wispy, high-strung, nervous child-woman to a stunning ramp diva. Watch her handle her wardrobe malfunction, make faces at her nagging manager or exchange bitter workplace truths with rival Priyanka in the ladies' washroom and you'll realise she's perfected the Girl Interrupted act after similar roles in Woh Lamhe, Life in a Metro and Gangster. The men? No place for them, specially since the women completely overshadow them.  Of course, the film desperately needs some tight editing to cut out the flab. Nevertheless, go, witness woman power, in all its agony and ecstasy.

Osama has been conveniently bumped off in his bunker by Turkish commando, Rizwan Khan (Vivek Oberoi), yet his tapes keep appearing on the popular Al Johara (Al Jazeera, did you say?) television network. The doctored tapes have been created by the media mogul (Niketan Dheer) who is in league with the terrorists and is spearheading mayhem, the world over, only to raise the TRPs. This time, the target is India, but for the brave Indian television anchor, Zayed Khan and his Turkish comrade-in-arms, Vivek Oberoi. Of course, they manage to find a third partner too in the desi Lara Croft (Shweta Bhardwaj) who has the uncanny knack of jumping in whenever the stakes are low. Quite a distraction, actually, especially since Hunk No. 1 (Zayed) is newly divorced from wife Shreya and Hunk No. 2 (Vivek) has lost his wife to the terrorists.The film has been shot well in the exotic locales of Istanbul, but there isn't much that Vivek's long hair and Zayed's serious be-spectacled look can do to save the film from ending up as a thriller that doesn't actually thrill. Even Abhishek Bachchan's item number fails to garner applause this time. The only time the film perks up is with the Bush humour. The American President wonders what's the problem with Turkey? Are the birds in short supply? he asks. And if that's not enough, he warns his aides to `leave those Indians alone with their pen drives' since all the call centres are in India and he must learn how to pronounce Man-mo-han, before he visits India.

The film boasts of a super cool look, testosterone-high action sequences, a lively music score (Pritam) and some classy performances from Akshaye and Saif as the bloodthirsty bhais. But the film does get staggered in the second half with the Anil Kapoor-Sameera Reddy track being the weakest link. Amongst the girlie brigade, it's Bipasha who adds glitz with her dangerous liaisons. Sameera too articulates the busty bimbo act with elan, reminiscent of TV's super-sleuth Karamchand's Kitty.

It's a soaring graph of roaring laughs.  movie  But that was then. Before David did the vanishing trick and Govinda was gone with the wind. Today the most successful duo of the '90s returns with evergreen Salman Khan (the hero is ageless at the box office), but the magic seems to have lost its spell. The laugh lines are just not there and the script is dull and flat. And now for irony No. 2. As with most of his films, David's picked this one too from Hollywood, only he rehashes the smart Will Smith-Eva Mendes Hitch into a ghoulash, minus the tadka.  Common man Govinda loses his heart to his stunning crorepati boss, Katrina Kaif. But for the boss, this podgy, bumbling, tongue-tied financial adviser is almost invisible... Until he hires a love guru (Salman Khan) who not only tutors him in the art of dancing, but promises to bring the fairy tale alive. So what, if in between, he himself gets love-struck by a tabloid journalist (Lara Dutta) who happens to be a single mom and has a penchant for chasing the Chhota Don (Rajpal Yadav), a spoof on the bada Don.  But more than the love stories, it is the chemistry between Salman and Govinda which carries the film through. Yet, this too isn't enough to tickle your funny bone. If Hitch revelled in its high Intelligence Quotient and its smart screenplay, Partner tries to find humour in silly rhymes, lowbrow gay gigs and unnecessary songs and jigs. Perhaps the best line comes at the end of the film when Salman asks Govinda what's wrong with his poster-size pix. You should be wearing a shirt and your low-waist jeans should cover your Calvin Klein briefs! Govinda tells him. But that's understandable from an overweight Govinda. For us, Sallu minus the shirt is just fine, as long as he covers up with a crackling film.  Disappointing. Disillusioning. Devastating, specially since we were expecting sooooo much from the David-Govinda-Salman combo! As for the couple of kudis, they have nothing to do, other than jump in when the music begins.

Yes, Shootout at Lokhandwala is primarily Viveik Oberoi's coming-of-age film. And the fact that all the other actors create unforgettable characters only makes his job simpler.  The wild and wicked nuances of Viveik's character are highlighted only because they are juxtaposed against the more restrained and sleek meanness of Sanjay Dutt, the encounter-friendly cop who believes the only way to clean up his office clutter is to kill the criminal and close the file. It is the fragile balance between the cops and robbers' gangs that lends this film its chutzpah. So that, eventually, you really do not know where your sympathies truly lie.  movie  Sometimes, you want the vardiwallahs to score in the incessant shootouts and sometimes you wish the dashing devils get their due and walk away with the taalis and seetis. Mostly, it is evil which has an upper hand and the allure of the Gang of Five, headed by Viveik, seems to overpower the muscle of the law, represented by Sanjay Dutt's three-man army. It is here the moral ambiguity — that director Apoorva Lakhia succeeds in giving Bollywood its first real desi Tarantino where the reservoir dogs truly have their day.  The city of Mumbai, once again, plays a pulsating, live entity in the film as the gangsters and the cops wage their relentless war for supremacy. The film is a potboiler, with the director never really letting go his grip on the medium; except in the song-dance sequences where the wild bunch live out their fantasies with the bar girl (Aarti Chabria). Only one song actually adds to the flavour of the film"},{"Name":"Raqeeb","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Tanushree Dutta, Rahul Khanna, Jimmy Shergill, Sharman Joshi","Director":"Anurag Singh","Genre":"Thriller","Duration":""},{"Name":"Ek Chalis Ki Last Local","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Abhay Deol, Neha Dhupia","Director":"Sanjay Khandoori","Genre":"Drama","Duration":""},{"Name":"Life In A...Metro","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Shiny Ahuja, Kay Kay Menon, Shilpa Shetty, Konkona Sen, Kangana Ranaut","Director":"Anurag Basu","Genre":"Drama","Duration":""},{"Name":"Good Boy Bad Boy","Release Time":"Mar 30 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Emraan Hashmi, Tusshar Kapoor, Isha Sharwani, Tanushree Dutta, Paresh Rawal","Director":"Ashwini Chaudhary","Genre":"Drama","Duration":""},{"Name":"Yatra","Release Time":"Apr 6 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Nana Patekar, Rekha, Deepti Naval","Director":"Gautam Ghosh","Genre":"Drama","Duration":""},{"Name":"Ta Ra Rum Pum","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Javed Jaffrey","Director":"Siddharth Anand","Genre":"Drama","Duration":""},{"Name":"Kya Love Story Hai","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Tusshar Kapoor, Ayesha Takia, Karan Hukku","Director":"Lovely Singh","Genre":"Romance","Duration":""},{"Name":"Big Brother","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Sunny Deol, Priyanka Chopra","Director":"Guddu Dhanoa","Genre":"Action","Duration":""},{"Name":"Life Mein Kabhie Kabhiee","Release Time":"Mar 30 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Dino Morea, Nauheed Cyrusi, Aftab Shivdasani, Sameer Dattani, Koel Puri","Director":"Vikram Bhatt","Genre":"Drama","Duration":""},{"Name":"Bheja Fry","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Vinay Pathak, Rajat Kapoor, Sarika","Director":"Sagar Ballary","Genre":"Comedy","Duration":""},{"Name":"Shakalaka Boom Boom","Release Time":"Mar 31 2016","Critic rating":"","Cast":"Upen Patel, Bobby Deol, Kangana Ranaut, Celina Jaitley","Director":"Suneel Darshan","Genre":"Drama","Duration":"","Review":" he suddenly decides to undo the little that he has done in screen history.

The rest, let's just leave unsaid. Specially since, her most intelligent statement is about how one should not drink iced water during a cold. Like his earlier films, the film serenades the small town girl once again as the epitome of virtues as opposed to the contrasexual cosmo gal. But unlike his earlier films, which somehow managed to ride on the charisma of Madhuri and Salman, Vivah almost suffocates you with it's holier-than-thou attitude.  More importantly, the film has no story whatsoever and is just a plain and simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah, interspersed with the usual picnics and clandestine rooftop trips. All this unfolds against a 'divya vatavaran', (spiritual environment) as the hero puts it, with the heroine serving umpteen glasses of 'jal' to the sundry chahchaji, chahchijis, bhabhijis...  For those who still like their cinema smelling of Savlon, Vivah is a one-call stop.

This week, she is mute. Amisha Patel's litany of celluloid woes seems to be endless. Little does she realise that she can never ever grab eyeballs of a gung-ho audience with her crying game. A bit of glamour and girl power might just do the trick, instead of a desperate attempt to kowtow the Meena Kumari cult.  Of course, here we have her seeking the brawny shoulder of Sunny Deol, the only hero who gave her a full blown hit, but the Gadar magic still remains history. Once again, it devolves on the bloated Deol machismo to save the frail girl from a bunch of killers who want her out of their way since she is the only witness to their heinous acts.  They have just ended up wiping the ketchup after murdering Neha who had left the secure arms of Sunny to try her luck at a beauty pageant. Silly Neha! the film tries to tell us. Why couldn't she just rest content with soppy domesticity, it regressively reiterates?  The film tries to follow Kalyug's diatribe against the 'hidden camera' and the prolific porn CD biz. Only, it lacks the earnest core and the ring of truth of the earlier film. Too desperate an attempt to protect the izzat of all those ma-behans always boomerangs. And so, the sorry state of Teesri Aankh which neither thrills nor chills.  "},{"Name":"Saawan...

In Fanaa, he scales the ladder some more and almost creates an actor's manual for impeccable acting. Undoubtedly, this was a difficult role and the possibilities of getting it wrong were immense. For, playing a terrorist who does the tightrope between love and a rogue nuclear bomb has all the potential of an ill-timed explosion.  movie  But Aamir displays a normalcy that is chilling -- yes, you can almost fall in love with the terrorist who masquerades as the friendly neighbourhood guide. And yet, when he must kill, he simply kills. No apologies for all the soulless violence.  The film belongs to Aamir, yes, but as Kajol's comeback vehicle, it leaves you with that million dollar query? Why did she have to turn her back to the industry for so many years? The actress still spells magic on the screen and makes the current breed seem quite faltu.  As Zooni, the blind Kashmiri girl who falls in love with the Dilli ka Romeo, Rehaan, she is simply irresistible. In fact, it is the poignancy of the romance between the ill-matched duo which makes the film more dramatic than the terrorist track that remains quite raw and undeveloped. Aamir, who masquerades as an Army officer, is actually a terrorist who dreams of Azaad Kashmir. And in between his sundry missions he meets Kajol, makes love to her, gives her the gift of sight and simply disappears...only to reappear again in her cocooned life.  The film may not be a chatpata entertainer but there is an elegant charm and a straight-from-the-heart feel which makes it worth a dekko. Just don't go looking for fun and faltu timepass.
